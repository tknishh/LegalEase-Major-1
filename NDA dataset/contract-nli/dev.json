      "text": "NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nTHIS AGREEMENT is made on the _________ day of _______________ 2015 between _________________________________________, a company incorporated in the Republic of Singapore and having its registered office at ______________________________________________________________, (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Company\u201d) of the one part and ALEXANDRA HEALTH PTE LTD, a company incorporated in the Republic of Singapore and having its registered office at 90 YISHUN CENTRAL SINGAPORE 768828 (hereinafter referred to as \u201cAHPL\u201d) of the other part.\nWHEREAS:\n(A) The parties, for their mutual benefit, may have exchanged and wish to further exchange certain information, including but not limited to, trade secrets and proprietary know-how in order that each of them may evaluate such information for the purpose of determining their respective interests in establishing a business relationship between them.\n(B) The parties wish to define their rights with respect to the said information and to protect the confidentiality thereof and proprietary features contained therein.\n(C) The Company acknowledges that all information or data relating to the Purpose whether in writing, orally or by any other means if disclosed (whether directly or indirectly) to a third (3rd) party without the express authorization of AHPL is highly confidential and would have a detrimental effect on the business of AHPL, and that its disclosure could not only expose AHPL to liability but also to judicial sanctions and that such disclosure might also adversely affect AHPL\u2019s patients and under certain circumstances, disclosure by the Company could expose the Company to criminal prosecution. In consideration of being made privy to the Confidential Information, the Company hereby agrees to observe and be bound by the terms of the Agreement.\n(D) The Company acknowledges that all information or data relating to Purpose also applies to any organisation/institution that is related to AHPL\n(i) either by reason of AHPL directly or indirectly controlling the organisation/institution; (ii) by reason of both AHPL and organisation/institution being controlled by or under the common control of a third party; or (iii) by reason that AHPL is obliged to provide support services to that organisation/institution for any reason. In the context of corporate entities, a person \u201ccontrols\u201d the entity if it owns and controls (i) more than fifty (50) percent of whose shares or other securities entitled to vote for election of directors (or other managing authority) in the entity, or\n(ii) more than fifty (50) percent of the equity interest in the entity, or (iii) is otherwise able to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of such person or entity whether by contract or otherwise.\nNOW IT IS HEREBY AGREED AS FOLLOWS:\n1. DEFINITIONS\nIn this Agreement, the following expressions shall have the following meanings:\n1.1 'Purpose' shall mean any discussions and negotiations between or within the parties concerning or in connection with the establishment of a business relationship between the parties.\n1.2\n(a) 'Confidential Information' shall mean all information received from the other party which the latter has indicated in writing or labelled to be \u201cConfidential\u201d, \u201cProprietary Information\u201d or with any other comparable legend to similar effect, at the time of disclosure [or if disclosed orally, confirmed in writing by the disclosing party as such within fifteen (15) days after its disclosure], which it may acquire in relation to the other party, including but without any limitation whatsoever:\n(i) all commercial, marketing and business information, strategic and development plans, intentions, any matter concerning AHPL, its affairs, business, operations, shareholders, directors, officers, business associates, clients or any other person or entity having dealings with AHPL;\n(ii) information relating to the financial condition of AHPL, its accounts, audited or otherwise, notes, memoranda, documents and/or records in any form whatsoever, whether electronic or otherwise; and\n(iii) scientific, technical, intellectual or other information in any form whatsoever, whether electronic or otherwise, relating to methods, processes, formulae, compositions, systems, techniques, product information, inventions, know-how, trade secrets, design rights, machines, computer programs, software, development codes and research projects; business plans, co-developer/collaborator identities, data, business records of every nature, customer lists and client database, pricing data, project records, market reports, sources of supply, employee lists, business manuals, policies and procedures, information relating to technologies or theory and all other information which may be disclosed by AHPL to the other party which the other party may be provided access by AHPL, whether stored electronically or otherwise; all information which is deemed by AHPL to be Confidential Information or which is generated as a result of or in connection with the business of AHPL and which is not generally available to the public; and all copies, reproductions and extracts thereof, in any format or manner of storage, whether in whole or in part, together with any other property of AHPL made or acquired by the other party or coming into their possession or control in any manner whatsoever.\n(b) All information as stated in Clause 1.2(a) above shall be and remain the sole property of the Discloser and shall be returned to the Discloser forthwith on demand at any time or without demand upon the termination of the other party's services.\n(c) The Company shall ensure that none of the patients of AHPL can be identified in any reports, submissions and publications of the Company, which shall be deemed to be Confidential information of AHPL within the meaning of this clause. Confidential Information does not include information:\n(i) which is or becomes public knowledge and public property in any way without breach of this Agreement by the Recipient;\n(ii) which the Recipient can show has been known or has been developed by or for the Recipient at any time independently of the information disclosed to it by the Discloser;\n(iii) which is hereafter disclosed or made available to the Recipient from a source other than the Discloser without breach by the Recipient or such source of any obligation of confidentiality or non-use towards the Discloser;\n(iv) which is hereafter made generally available by the Discloser or a third party or is disclosed by the Discloser to a third party without restriction on disclosure or use, including without limitation, by way of the publication of a patent specification;\n(v) which is disclosed orally unless it is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure and confirmed as such in writing by the Discloser within thirty (30) days of disclosure;\n(vi) which is disclosed by the Recipient with the prior written approval of the Discloser; or\n(vii) in respect of which a period of five (5) years has elapsed from the date of signature of this Agreement\nPROVIDED HOWEVER THAT the foregoing exceptions shall not apply to information relating to any combination of features or any combination of items of information merely because information relating to one or more of the relevant individual features or one or more of the relevant items (but not the combination itself) falls within any one or more of such exceptions.\n1.3 Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary in this Agreement, any information relating or pertaining to the patients of AHPL shall be deemed to be Confidential Information of AHPL.\n2. HANDLING OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION\n2.1 In consideration of the mutual exchange and disclosure of Confidential Information, each party undertakes in relation to the other party's Confidential Information:\n(a) to maintain the same in confidence and to use it only for the Purpose and for no other purpose and in particular, but without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing:\n(i) not to make any commercial use thereof;\n(ii) not to use the same for the benefit of itself or of any third (3rd) party other than pursuant to a further agreement with the other party; and\n(iii) not to use the same for the purpose of guiding or conducting a search of any information, materials or sources, whether or not available to the public, for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation, for the purpose of demonstrating that any information falls within one (1) of the exceptions in Clause 1;\n(b) not to copy, reproduce or reduce to writing any part thereof except as may be reasonably necessary for the Purpose and that any copies, reproductions or reductions to writing so made shall be the property of the Discloser;\n(c) not to disclose the same whether to its employees or to third (3rd) parties except in confidence to such of its directors, employees, servants, agents, officers, representatives, consultants, independent contractors and professional advisors who need to know the same for the Purpose and that:\n(i) such directors, employees, servants, agents, officers, representatives, consultants, independent contractors and professional advisors are obliged by their contracts of employment or service not to disclose the same; and\n(ii) the Recipient shall enforce such obligations at its expense and at the request of the Discloser in so far as breach thereof relates to the Discloser's Confidential Information;\n(d) to be responsible for the performance of sub-clauses (a), (b) and (c) above on the part of its employees or directors to whom the same is disclosed pursuant to sub-clause (c) above; and\n(e) to apply thereto no lesser security measures and degree of care than those which the Recipient applies to its own confidential or proprietary information of similar nature and which the Recipient warrants as providing adequate protection of such information from unauthorised disclosure, copying or use.\n2.2 The Company shall cause its directors, agents, employees, servants, officers, representatives, consultants, independent contractors and professional advisors involved in the Purpose to observe or be similarly bound by the terms of Agreement. The Company as the principal party shall be responsible and held liable for any breach of this Agreement by any of its directors, agents, employees, servants, officers, representatives, consultants, independent contractors and professional advisors.\n2.3 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Recipient shall be entitled to make any disclosure required by law of the other party's Confidential Information, but shall give the other party not less than two (2) business days' notice of such disclosure and shall consult with the Discloser prior to such disclosure with a view to avoiding such disclosure if legally possible.\n3. RETURN OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION\nEach party shall:\n(a) within one (1) month of completion of the purpose or receipt of a written request from the other party, return to the other party all documents and materials (and all copies thereof) containing the other party's Confidential Information and certify in writing to the other party that it has complied with the requirements of this sub-clause; and\n(b) notwithstanding the completion of the Purpose or return of the documents and materials as aforesaid, continue to be bound by the undertakings set out in Clause 2.\n4. DATA PROTECTION\n4.1 Any data provided by AHPL to the Company and used by the Company directly or directly in the performance of this Agreement shall remain at all times the property of AHPL. It shall be identified, clearly marked and recorded as such by the Company on all media and in all documentation.\n4.2 The Company shall take all reasonable precautions and adequate measures to preserve the integrity and prevent any corruption or loss, damage or destruction of AHPL\u2019s data.\n4.3 In the event of termination of this Agreement, the Company shall when directed to do so by AHPL, and instruct all its agents and sub-contractors to erase all data provided by AHPL and all copies of any part of the data provided by AHPL from the Company\u2019s systems and magnetic data.\n4.4 All data acquired by the Company from AHPL shall only be used for the purposes of this Agreement and shall not be further processed or disclosed without the prior consent of AHPL.\n4.5 The data will not be transferred or made available to any Third (3rd) Party without the prior written consent of AHPL.

Upon completion of this Agreement, the data will be either returned to AHPL or disposed of under the Company\u2019s supervision in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations, and the written instructions of AHPL.\n4.6 The parties shall comply at all times with the Personal Data Protection Act 2012.\n5. DISCLAIMER AND WARRANTY\n5.1 Each party reserves all rights in its Confidential Information and no rights or obligations other than those expressly recited here are granted or to be implied from this Agreement. In particular, no licence is hereby granted directly or indirectly under any patents, patent applications, inventions, discoveries, copyrights or other intellectual property rights now or in the future held, made, obtained or licensable by either party.\n5.2 Each party warrants its right to disclose its Confidential Information to the other party and to authorise the other party to use the same for the Purpose.\n6. CONFIDENTIALITY OF THIS AGREEMENT Each party agrees to keep the existence and nature of this Agreement confidential and not to use the same or the name of the other party or of any other company in the Group of Companies of which the other party forms part in any publicity, advertisement or other disclosure with regard to this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.\n7. DAMAGES NOT AN ADEQUATE REMEDY\nThe Recipient and Discloser both acknowledge that the Confidential Information has been developed or obtained by one another through the investment of significant time, effort and expense, and that such Confidential Information provides the other with a significant competitive advantage over its competitors. The Recipient and Discloser both understand and agree that any breach of this Agreement will result in irreparable harm to the Discloser and because of the unique nature of the Confidential Information, monetary damages may not be an adequate remedy in the event of such a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement. Accordingly, the Discloser and Recipient agree that the Party seeking remedy shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance, in the event of a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement in addition to all other remedies available to the Party seeking remedy at law or in equity.\n8. NO GRANT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS\n8.1 All Confidential Information remains the property of the Discloser.\n8.2 The Discloser reserves all rights in the Confidential Information and no rights or obligations other than those expressly recited herein are granted or to be implied from this Agreement. In particular, no license is hereby granted directly or indirectly under any patent, invention, discovery, copyright or other industrial property right now or in the future held, made, obtained or licensable by the Discloser.\n8.3 The Recipient shall not file any copyright registrations, patent applications or similar registrations of ownership on the Confidential Information. In the event that the Recipient does so in violation of this Agreement, the Recipient shall assign absolutely to the Discloser such registrations and applications without any cost to the Discloser.\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY\nIn carrying out their respective obligations under this Agreement, the Company and AHPL shall comply with all laws and regulations applicable thereto but save for wilful acts, default or gross negligence on their respective parts, neither party shall be liable to the other party for any indirect, incidental, special, punitive or consequential damages however caused, including any loss of profits or business interruption costs and under any theory of liability, including but not limited to contract, strict liability and negligence; whether or not the other party has been advised of the possibility of such damage.\n10. NOTICES\n10.1 Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, notices which are required to be given under or permitted by this Agreement shall be in writing (unless expressly stated otherwise) and sent to the address of the recipient set out in this Agreement. All notices may be sent by hand or by AR Registered post or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid and properly addressed to the offices of the parties as specified in this Agreement or to such other address as the party may later specify.\n10.2 Every notice or communication so sent shall be deemed to have been properly served and validly made, if by hand when delivered to the recipient\u2019s address or if sent by AR Registered post, two (2) days after posting if posted to an address within Singapore and eight (8) days after posting, if posted to an address outside Singapore, notwithstanding the fact that the letter may be returned by the Post Office undelivered.\n11. TERMINATION\nThis Agreement shall continue to be in force from the date hereof until terminated by mutual consent or by either party giving to the other not\nless than thirty (30) days\u2019 prior written notice. The provision of Clauses 1 to 8, 11 to 15 and 17 to 21 shall survive any such termination.\n12. NON-ASSIGNMENT\nSubject to the other provisions of this Agreement, all the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective permitted assigns and successors-in-title except that:-\n(i) neither party shall transfer or assign all or any of its rights, obligations or benefits hereunder in whole or in part to any third (3rd) party, without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld;\n(ii) any permitted assignee or transferee shall agree in writing to comply with all terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n(iii) any assignment shall not exceed the existing scope of this Agreement.\n13. SEVERABILITY\n13.1 In the event that any term, condition or provision contained in this Agreement or the application of any such term, condition or provision shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be wholly or partly illegal, invalid, unenforceable or a violation of any applicable law, statute or regulation of any jurisdiction, the same shall be deemed to be deleted from this Agreement and shall be of no force and effect; whereas the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect as if such term, condition and provision had not originally been contained in this Agreement, unless the severed provisions render the continuing performance of this Agreement impossible, or materially change either party\u2019s rights or obligations under this Agreement; in which event such party may give written notice of its intent to terminate this Agreement to the other party.\n13.2 Notwithstanding the aforesaid, in the event of such deletion, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith in order to agree to terms of mutually acceptable and satisfactory alternative provisions in place of the provision(s) so deleted.\n14. WAIVER\n14.1 No waiver of any breach of any covenant, condition, stipulation, obligation or provision contained or implied in this Agreement shall operate or be interpreted as a waiver of another breach of the same or of any covenant, condition, stipulation, obligation or provision in this Agreement.\n14.2 Any time or other indulgence granted by AHPL under this Agreement shall be without prejudice to and shall not be taken as a waiver of any of AHPL\u2019s rights under this Agreement nor shall it prejudice or in any way limit or affect any statutory rights or powers from time to time vested in or exercisable by AHPL.\n15. DISPUTE RESOLUTION\n15.1 In the event of any dispute or difference arising out of or in connection with or in relation to this Agreement or the existence, validity, termination, application or interpretation of this Agreement or any of its provisions, both parties shall use their best endeavours to settle the dispute informally by agreement between the parties. Both parties shall always act in good faith and co-operate with each other to resolve any disputes.\n15.2 Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, if the dispute is not settled in accordance with Clause 14.1 above, no party shall proceed to litigation or any other form of dispute resolution unless the parties have made reasonable efforts to resolve the same through mediation in accordance with the mediation rules of the Singapore Mediation Centre. A party who receives a notice for mediation from the other party shall consent and participate in the mediation process in accordance with this clause. Failure to comply with this clause shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement.\n15.3 In the event that mediation is unsuccessful, the dispute shall be resolved either by reference to arbitration or by court proceedings as elected by either party, by way of a written notice to the other party, which shall state the specific dispute to be resolved and the nature of such dispute.\n15.4 Any reference to arbitration in Singapore shall be a submission to arbitration within the meaning of the Arbitration Act for the time being in force in Singapore. Such arbitration shall be conducted in the English language in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (\u201cSIAC Rules\u201d) for the time being in force, which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this clause, except in so far as such Rules conflict with the provisions of Clause 14 herein, in which event the provisions of Clause 14 herein will prevail.\n15.5 The arbitration tribunal shall consist of one (1) arbitrator to be appointed by mutual agreement between the parties. Either party may propose to the other the name or names of one or more persons, one of whom should serve as an arbitrator. If no agreement is reached within thirty (30) days after receipt by one party of such a proposal from the other, the arbitrator shall be appointed by the Appointing Authority.\n15.6 The Appointing Authority shall be the Chairman of the SIAC.\n15.7 The arbitrator must not be a present or former employee or agent of, or consultant or counsel to, either party or any related corporation [as defined in Section 6 of the Companies Act (Cap. 50)] of either party.\n15.8 Any decision or award of an arbitration tribunal appointed pursuant to this clause will be final and binding on the parties.\n15.9 Interest at the annual rate of six per cent (6%) per annum will be due and payable to the party in receipt of an arbitration award from such date as the arbitral tribunal may decide until the date of payment to such party.\n15.10 The parties hereto undertake to keep the arbitration proceedings and all information, pleadings, documents, evidence and all matters relating thereto confidential.\n15.11 The application of Part II of the International Arbitration Act, and the Model Law referred thereto, to this Agreement is hereby excluded.\n15.12 For the avoidance of doubt, it is agreed that nothing in Clause 14 shall prevent a party from seeking urgent equitable relief before any appropriate court and the commencement of any dispute resolution proceedings shall in no way affect the continual performance of the parties\u2019 obligations under this Agreement.\n16. PROFESSIONAL FEES\nIn any suit or other proceeding relating to the subject matter of the Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the other party all reasonable costs, fees and expenses by accountants, solicitors and other professionals for services rendered to the prevailing party in connection with the suit or other proceeding, including costs, fees and expenses of preparation and appeal.\n17. EXPORT CONTROL LAWS AND REGULATIONS\nEach party agrees to comply with all export laws and regulations (including \u201cdeemed export\u201d and \u201cdeemed re-export\u201d regulations) of the United States and any other relevant local export laws and regulations (\u201cExport Laws\u201d) to ensure that no data, information, program and/or deliverable (or direct product thereof) is (a) exported, directly or indirectly, in violation of Export Laws; or (b) used for any purposes prohibited by the Export Laws, including without limitation, nuclear, chemical or biological weapons proliferation or development of missile technology.\n18.

The parties agree that this Agreement and all Schedules annexed to the same constitute the entire agreement between them with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and that it supersedes all prior or contemporaneous proposals, agreements, negotiations, representations, warranties, understandings, correspondence and all other communications (whether written or oral, express or implied) or arrangements entered into between the parties prior to this Agreement in respect of the matters dealt with in it. No promise, inducement, representation or agreement other than as expressly set forth in this Agreement has been made to or by the parties.\n19. NO PARTNERSHIP\nNothing contained in or relating to this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute a partnership or agency relationship between the parties and no party shall have any authority to act for or assume any obligation or responsibility of any kind, express or implied on behalf of the other party or bind or commit the other party for any purpose in any way whatsoever.\n20. GOVERNING LAW\n20.1 This Agreement shall be deemed to be made in Singapore, subject to, governed by and construed in all respects in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Singapore for every intent and purpose.\n20.2 The parties hereby agree to submit irrevocably to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of the Republic of Singapore to settle any and all disputes in connection with this Agreement.\n21.

In addition, upon the completion of the services provided by VENDOR to BPS as outlined in this Agreement, VENDOR shall return or destroy, as BPS may instruct, all Confidential Information in VENDOR\u2019S possession or control, whether in printed, electronic or any other format, including all duplicates and copies thereof of any files, compilation, study, report, analysis or data base containing, based on or derived from the Confidential Information.\n7. Publication. BPS has the right to report, present, publish, or otherwise use data to which it has produced or received from VENDOR. Acceptable disclosure includes, but is not limited to, disclosure of aggregate or de-identified data in reports and presentations, including for grant reporting purposes, disclosure of aggregate or de-identified data to VENDOR, public entities and community based organizations, and use of aggregate or de-identified data in program planning, evaluation and research not related to the BPI initiative.

BPS has the right to review and require approval of any publicly reported document prior to its release.\n8. Disclosure, Breach & Penalties. VENDOR\u2019S disclosure of Confidential Information to third parties without BPS's authorization, or VENDOR\u2019S failure to sign or comply with this agreement or return or destroy Confidential Information per Provision 4 above, may constitute a breach of this Agreement and may result in the BPS or the U.S. Department of Education denying VENDOR access to Confidential Information and other such penalties as dictated by law or equity.\n9. Injunctive Relief. VENDOR acknowledges and agrees that the breach or threatened breach by VENDOR, or its employees and/or representatives of their obligations under this Agreement will cause serious and irreparable harm to BPS that cannot be adequately compensated by monetary damages alone and that BPS may seek injunctive relief from an appropriate court to protect BPS from such harm without necessity of bond or other security.\n10.

BPS may terminate this agreement with VENDOR at any time, for any reason, with either written or verbal notice. VENDOR must give the designated BPS representative 3-day written and verbal notice of any termination of this agreement with BPS. Termination of this Agreement, however, does not affect any Party\u2019s obligations, duties or rights imposed or granted by separate instrument such as a grant or other contract.\n13. Indemnification. Unless otherwise exempted by law, VENDOR shall indemnify and hold harmless the City of Boston, Boston Public Schools, and its Departments, agents, officers, and employees against any and all claims, liabilities, and costs for damages that the City may sustain which arise out of or in connection with VENDOR\u2019S performance of this Agreement, including but not limited to the negligent, reckless or intentional conduct of VENDOR, its employees and/or representatives, officers, or other related personnel. After prompt notification of a claim by the City, VENDOR shall have an opportunity to participate in the defense of such claim and any negotiated settlement agreement or judgment. The City and its departments shall not be liable for any costs incurred by VENDOR arising under this paragraph. Any indemnification of VENDOR shall be subject to appropriation and applicable law. Indemnification specifically includes, but is not limited to, claims related to (i) the indemnifying Party\u2019s improper sharing of data, (ii) improper use of data by the indemnifying Party or any of the indemnifying Party\u2019s employees, agents, officers, volunteers, or other related personnel, or (iii) breach of the indemnifying Party\u2019s IT system.\n14. Relationship of Parties. The VENDOR, its employees, and/or representatives shall not be construed, deemed or otherwise held to be employees, agents, or officers of BPS. VENDOR and its employees and/or representatives shall not be entitled to compensation or other benefits that ordinarily accrue to employees of BPS. Nothing herein shall create or be deemed to create any relationship of agency, association, joint venture, partnership as defined by law, or employer/employee between BPS and VENDOR or its employees or representatives.

Termination. This Agreement shall survive the termination of the services to be provided by VENDOR or any other agreement by and between the parties.\n18. Severability. All of the provisions of this agreement are severable. If any provision of this Agreement is rendered invalid or unenforceable by State or Federal statute or regulations or declared null and void by any court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.\n19. Entire Agreement; Amendments. This Agreement is intended as the complete, final and exclusive statement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes any prior agreements or understandings between the parties hereto. This Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented only by a written agreement signed by VENDOR and BPS. Any waiver of the terms and conditions of this Agreement must be in writing signed by the party granting such waiver and shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure to perform.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, and intending to be legally bound, the parties have executed this Agreement by their duly authorized representatives.\nThe Boston Public Schools (\u201cBPS\u201d)\nSignature: _____________________________ Date: __________________\nPrint Name:____________________________\nTitle: _________________________________\n(VENDOR) ____________________________\nSignature:______________________________ Date __________________\nPrint Name:_____________________________\nTitle: __________________________________\nIf the vendor is not an individual, each individual of a particular vendor who will be working with this data is required to submit a signed NDA.\n",

Each Party shall treat all Confidential Information in every form as confidential, and shall not reveal, divulge or disclose Confidential Information, at any time or for any reason, to any third person or entity. This provision shall survive the expiration, termination or cancellation of this Agreement in accordance with Section 9.\n6. Defend Against Third Party Requests. Each Party and Reviewing Representative shall defend against disclosure of Confidential Information pursuant to any Third Party Request through all available legal processes, including, but not limited to, seeking to obtain any necessary protective orders. Each Party and Reviewing Representative shall provide PJM, and PJM shall provide each Disclosing Party, with prompt notice of any such Third Party Request or legal proceedings, and shall consult with PJM and/or any Disclosing Party in its efforts to deny the request or defend against such legal process. In the event a protective order or other remedy is denied, each Party agrees to furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which its legal counsel advises PJM (and of which PJM shall, in turn, advise any Disclosing Party) in writing is legally required to be furnished, and to exercise their best efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such Confidential Information.\n7. Permitted Limited Disclosure of Confidential Information. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, a Party may disclose Confidential Information to the extent but only to the extent: (a) approved by the Disclosing Party in writing; or (b) required by Law or an Authority, but only if: (i) the Party attempts to notify the Disclosing Party as far in advance as practicable prior to making disclosure of its intent to disclose Confidential Information and of the content and mode of communication of the disclosure; and (ii) the Party cooperates with the Disclosing Party's efforts to obtain a protective order protecting the Confidential Information from disclosure. In addition, if disclosure is required by Law or Authority, the Party to the extent practicable (and permitted by law), will (1) promptly notify the Disclosing Party of the circumstances surrounding the requirement, (2) consult with the Disclosing Party on available options to request confidential treatment and/or the advisability of taking legally available steps to resist or narrow the request or requirement for disclosure, and (3) disclose such Confidential Information only after using all reasonable efforts to comply with subsections (1) and (2) above and after cooperating with the Disclosing Party\u2019s reasonable efforts to obtain a protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to any portion of the Confidential Information designated for such treatment by the Disclosing Party. The Party will furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information that is responsive to the request or requirement for disclosure, and will request that confidential treatment be accorded to the Confidential Information by the person(s) to whom the Party is required by Law or Authority to disclose the Confidential Information. Notwithstanding anything stated in this Agreement, the Disclosing Party shall retain the burden of prosecuting any action and/or seeking injunctive relief to prevent disclosure of the Confidential Information. Disclosure of Confidential Information in accordance with the terms of this paragraph shall not constitute a waiver of the protections under this Agreement or the confidentiality of such Confidential Information and such Confidential Information shall continue to be treated as confidential in accordance with this Agreement.\n8. Ownership and Use of Confidential Information. All Confidential Information delivered by a Disclosing Party to a Party pursuant to this Agreement shall be and remain the property of the Disclosing Party, and such Confidential Information shall be promptly returned to the Disclosing Party upon request. That portion of the Confidential Information that may be found in analyses, compilations, studies or other documents prepared by or for a Party and all Confidential Information that is oral will be kept by a Party subject to the terms of this Agreement or destroyed. Neither the Party nor its Reviewing Representatives shall use the Confidential Information for any purpose whatsoever except for the purpose of executing the Reviewing Party\u2019s Transmission Functions.

Identification of Confidential Information. Confidential Information that is in writing or other tangible form (including electronic form) shall be subject to this Agreement only if it is clearly marked as \"Confidential\" when disclosed by the Disclosing Party to a Party. Confidential Information that is provided orally shall be subject to this Agreement only if its confidential nature is announced at the time of disclosure and an outline of the scope of the information provided is reduced to writing, with a copy provided to the Party within ten (10) calendar days of oral disclosure of the information. Inadvertent failure to mark Confidential Information as \u201cConfidential\u201d at the time it is disclosed shall not be deemed a waiver by the Disclosing Party of the protections of this Agreement provided that such Confidential Information is identified and marked \"Confidential\" promptly upon the discovery of its inadvertent disclosure. Confidential Information excludes any information that: (i) the Disclosing Party has not specifically notified the Party is confidential; (ii) becomes available to the Party or the Reviewing Representative on a non-confidential basis from a source other than:\n(a) the Disclosing Party, or other person acting on behalf of the Disclosing Party; or (b) a Party who has confidentiality obligations to the Disclosing Party; (iii) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by the Party or its Reviewing Representatives; (iv) was previously known to the Party or its Reviewing Representative free and clear of any obligation to keep it confidential; (v) is disclosed to third parties by the Disclosing Party without restriction or obligation of confidentiality; (vi) is developed independently by the Party as evidenced by documentation made in the ordinary course of business by the Party; or (vii) the Disclosing Party notifies the Party that such information is no longer Confidential Information.\n10. Term of Agreement. This Agreement shall remain in effect unless and until terminated by the Parties. The obligations of the Parties under this Agreement shall continue and survive the Transmission Functions for which the Confidential Information was disclosed and shall remain binding under this Agreement unless disclosure is permitted under Section 8 or required by Law or Authority. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the term of protection of Confidential Information otherwise protected by Law or Authority.\n11. Disclaimer of Warranties. Each Party hereby disclaims and does not make any express or implied representation or warranty concerning the accuracy or completeness of Confidential Information and no Disclosing Party shall have liability to the Party for the Party\u2019s use of Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party. In addition, nothing in this Agreement requires the disclosure of Confidential Information or supersedes the discretion of the Disclosing Party. In addition, nothing in this Agreement requires the disclosure of Confidential Information or supersedes the discretion of the Disclosing Party to determine the extent of the Confidential Information disclosed. Disclosure of Confidential Information of any nature shall not obligate the Disclosing Party to disclose any further Confidential Information.\n12. No License. No license to the Party, under any trademark, patent copyright, mask work protection right or any other intellectual property right, is either granted or implied by the conveying of Confidential Information to such Party. None of the Confidential Information which may be disclosed by a Disclosing Party shall constitute any representation, warranty, assurance, guarantee or inducement by such Disclosing Party to any other Party of any kind, and, in particular, with respect to the non-infringement of trademarks, patents, copyrights, or any other intellectual property rights, or other rights of third persons.\n13. No Implied Agreement. Except as provided herein, no Party shall be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever by virtue of this Agreement.\n14. Compliance with Law. Nothing stated herein shall be construed to require any Party to take any action in violation of applicable Laws or regulations.\n15. Miscellaneous.\na. Binding Effect. The obligations of the Parties shall be binding on and inure to the benefit of their respective heirs, successors, assigns, and affiliates.\nb. Integration. This Agreement constitutes the Parties\u2019 entire agreement concerning the subject matter hereof and may be amended or modified only by a subsequent agreement in writing. A waiver, discharge, amendment, modification or termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof, shall be valid and effective only if in writing and executed by all Parties. A written waiver of a right, remedy or obligation under a provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of the provision itself, a waiver of any succeeding right, remedy or obligation under the provision, or a waiver of any other right, remedy, or obligation under this Agreement. Any delay or failure by a Party in enforcing any obligation or in exercising any right or remedy shall not operate as a waiver of it or affect that party\u2019s right later to enforce the obligation or exercise the right or remedy and a single or partial exercise of a right of remedy by a Party does not preclude any further exercise of it or the exercise of any other right or remedy of that Party.\nc.

The Company and the Stockholder are each individually referred to herein as a \u201cParty\u201d and are collectively referred to as the \u201cParties.\u201d\nWHEREAS, on or about April 30, 2015, the Stockholder made a demand (the \u201cDemand\u201d) to inspect the stockholder list of the Company;\nWHEREAS, pursuant to the Demand and subject to the Stockholder executing this Agreement, the Company has agreed to allow the Stockholder to inspect the stockholder list (which, together with information or analyses derived from information made available for inspection, is referred to as the \u201cConfidential Material\u201d);\nWHEREAS, the Company believes that stockholder list contains confidential information; IT IS HEREBY AGREED, by and between the Parties, this 30th day of April 2015, as follows:\n1. Stockholder agrees that the Confidential Material is being produced to them only for purposes reasonably related to Stockholder\u2019s interests as a stockholder of the Company and that Stockholder shall not utilize Confidential Material, any other information produced by the Company or anything derived from Confidential Material or derived from any other information produced by the Company for any other purpose.\n2. The Stockholder will not disclose, publish, or communicate Confidential Material to any person or entity in any form (written, oral, electronic or through any other medium), either directly or indirectly, except as provided in this Confidentiality Agreement to end; provided that in no event shall stockholder, directly or indirectly, publically disclose, publish or communicate names, addresses, holdings of any other stockholder.\n3. If the Stockholder is required (by interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigatory demand, or any similar process relating to any legal proceeding, investigation, hearing, or otherwise) to disclose in any manner any Confidential Material, the Stockholder will provide the Company with prompt notice (i.e., within 2 business days of receipt of such interrogatory, subpoena, demand, or any similar process), so that the Company may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with this Agreement in the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or if the Company waives compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, the Stockholder may furnish only such Confidential Material as they are advised is legally required and must exercise their best efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to any Confidential Material.\n4. Each Party who receives Confidential Material pursuant to this Agreement agrees to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery in any action to enforce any provision of, or based on any right or claim arising out of, this Agreement including any action to determine any dispute as to the confidentiality of any information or document produced by the Company. Each Party hereby expressly waives any and all objections such Party may have to personal jurisdiction or to venue, including without limitation the inconvenience of such forum, in the Court of Chancery.\n5. Each Party agrees that the Company does not have an adequate remedy at law in the event of a breach of this Agreement by the Stockholder. The Parties further agree that, in the event of a breach of this Agreement by the Stockholder, the Company will suffer irreparable harm and will be entitled to specific performance and/or injunctive relief to enforce the terms of this Agreement. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for any breach of this Agreement but shall be in addition to any other remedies to which the Company may be entitled at law or in equity.\n6. This Agreement may not be amended, changed, waived, discharged, or terminated (except as explicitly provided herein), in whole or in part, except by an instrument in writing that refers specifically to this Agreement and that is signed by the Party against whom enforcement of such amendment, change, waiver, discharge, or termination is sought. The waiver by any Party of any breach of this Agreement will not be deemed or construed as a waiver of any other breach of this Agreement, whether prior, subsequent, or contemporaneous. No failure or delay in exercising any right, power, or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof.\n7. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective agents, executors, heirs, beneficiaries, successors, and assigns.\n8. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of laws principles.\n9. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts by any of the signatories hereto and as so executed shall constitute one agreement.\n10. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with regard to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, written and oral, between the Parties with regard to the subject matter hereof.\n11. This Agreement will be deemed to have been mutually prepared by the Parties and will not be construed against either of them by reason of authorship.\n",

      "text": "CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nThis Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement (Confidentiality Agreement) is made between The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc., (NASDAQ OMX) a Delaware Corporation whose principal offices are located at One Liberty Plaza, New York, New York, 10006 Corporation (NASDAQ OMX and its affiliates are collectively referred to as the Corporations), and ________________________ (Recipient), whose principal offices are located at ___________________________________________.\nIn consideration of NASDAQ OMX\u2019s past, present, and/or future provision of access to certain confidential information by Recipient in order to permit Recipient to evaluate, plan for, implement, complete obligations under an Agreement for Professional Services, or participate in projects, contracts, or other arrangements between the parties (Project) and other good and valuable consideration, the sufficiency of which is acknowledged, it is agreed as follows:\n1. Recipient may be provided with access to selected information (oral, written, or electronic) of the other (including of any of the Corporations) which helps meet a regulatory purpose or business need, including, but not limited to, that information which relates or refers to: business planning; internal controls; computer, data processing, or communications architectures or systems; electronic data processing architectures, applications, programs, routines, or subroutines; business affairs and methods of operation or proposed methods of operations, techniques or systems of a party (including of any of the Corporations) or any customer of a party (including of any of the Corporations); financial or other non-public information. Some of the information in each of these categories is confidential in nature or constitutes a trade secret. This information received from a party (including of any of the Corporations), either orally or in writing, during the course of the Project shall be deemed to be confidential information (Confidential Information) for purposes of this Confidentiality Agreement. Notes, documents, summaries or reports which are prepared from Confidential Information to the extent such specifically refer or relate to Confidential Information are themselves Confidential Information.\n2. Recipient acknowledges the sensitive and secret nature of the Confidential Information it will have access to during the term of this Agreement and agrees that it will treat such Confidential Information as strictly confidential and shall exercise the same degree of care in the protection of the Confidential Information as the Recipient exercises with respect to its own proprietary property and trade secrets, but in no event shall it be less than a reasonable degree of care given the nature of the Confidential Information.\n3. Recipient shall not disclose Confidential Information to any person or entity, except its employees or partners involved in the Project, or to use the Confidential Information for any purpose other than fulfilling its obligations under the Project. Recipient acknowledges and agrees that breach of this Confidentiality Agreement by Recipient and/or anyone employed by or otherwise associated with Recipient may also constitute a violation of the Insider Trading Act and/or other securities and other laws. Access to or disclosure of Confidential Information by Recipient shall be limited to those employees or partners covered by a then effective legal obligation or agreement with Recipient that prohibits the disclosure or unauthorized use of confidential information deemed confidential by Recipient (Authorized Employees). The existence of such an agreement with an employee or partner of the Recipient shall not operate to relieve the Recipient from liability for acts of such employee or partner that result in a breach of this Confidentiality Agreement.\n4. Recipient shall not make copies of the Confidential Information except for those copies required for use by Authorized Employees in the performance of the Agreement. Each copy, including its storage media, shall be marked Confidential, and also include all copyright, trademark and other proprietary notices which appear on the original. The Recipient agrees that all Confidential Information, including any copies thereof, shall be returned to NASDAQ OMX or destroyed within ten (10) days of the expiration or other termination of the Project.\n5. Notes and other documents referencing or relating to Confidential Information may be made and kept by the Recipient, but shall continue to be governed by this Confidentiality Agreement until they are destroyed.\n6. All intellectual property rights associated with the Confidential Information, including without limitation, patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret rights, and moral rights shall remain in NASDAQ OMX.\n7. The obligation of non-disclosure shall not extend to: (1) information which is then already in the possession of the Recipient and not under a duty of non-disclosure; (2) information which is generally known or revealed to the public other than by breach of this Agreement; (3) information which is revealed to the Recipient by a third party--unless such party is under a duty of non-disclosure; or (4) information which the Recipient develops independently of the disclosure as indicated by files existing at the time of initial disclosure.\n8. In the event Recipient receives a subpoena or other validly issued administrative or judicial process requesting Confidential Information, Recipient shall provide prompt actual notice to the General Counsel of NASDAQ OMX of such receipt, providing the Corporations with a reasonable opportunity to intervene in the proceeding before the time that Recipient is required to comply with such subpoena or other process. In the event that NASDAQ OMX instructs Recipient not to comply with any portion or all of the process, Recipient shall comply with such instructions and NASDAQ OMX shall indemnify and hold harmless the Recipient from any damages to the extent that Recipient's damages result from its compliance with NASDAQ OMX's instructions.\n9. Recipient acknowledges that NASDAQ OMX, because of the nature of the Confidential Information, would suffer irreparable harm in the event of a material breach of the provisions of this Confidentiality Agreement in that monetary damages would be inadequate to compensate NASDAQ OMX for such a breach, and that in the event of any material breach or threatened material breach by the Recipient of any such provisions, NASDAQ OMX shall be entitled, in addition to such other legal or equitable remedies which might be available, to injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction against the threatened material breach or continuation of any such material breach without showing or proving any actual damages sustained by NASDAQ OMX. If NASDAQ OMX prevails in any action brought to enjoin a material breach or threatened breach of this Confidentiality Agreement, it shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees and costs in connection with such legal proceeding. This Confidentiality Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its principles of conflicts of laws.\n10. The representations and obligations of the Recipient relative to the Confidential Information shall survive the termination of this Confidentiality Agreement for a period up to three (3) years from the date of the completion or other termination of the Project.\n11. This Confidentiality Agreement contains the full and complete understanding of Recipient and NASDAQ OMX with respect to the subject matter and supersedes all prior representations and understandings whether they be oral or written.\n12. Recipient and NASDAQ OMX understand and agree that in the event any part, term or provision of this Confidentiality Agreement is held to be invalid or legally unenforceable, the validity of the remaining parts, terms or provisions shall not be affected, and the rights and obligations of the parties shall be construed and enforced as if the Confidentiality Agreement did not contain the particular part, term, or provision held to be invalid.\n13. The persons executing this Confidentiality Agreement warrant that they have the authority to bind NASDAQ OMX and the Recipient to the terms and conditions embodied in this Confidentiality Agreement.\nAgreed and Accepted:\n____________________________________ (Recipient)\nBy: __________________________________________________________\nTitle: __________________________________________________________\nAuthorized Officer\nDate: __________________________________________________________\nThe NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.

      "text": "CONFIDENTIALITY OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\n1. This Non-Disclosure Agreement is entered into by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and __________________________________, ___________________________________ on _______________. (Name of Contractor) (Name of Contracting Company) (mm/dd/yyyy)\nVA and the contractor have entered into a contract, _________________________________________________ (Enter identifying information on contract) ___________________________________________________________________________________________ under which the contractor will _________________________________________________________________ (Enter task that the contractor will perform) ___________________________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________________________________.\n2. In order to perform this contract, the contractor will need access to VA data, software, and computer systems either at a VA location, at the contractor's place of business, or both, in accordance with the contract.\n3. By signing this agreement, the contractor acknowledges and understands the following:\na. The contractor and any subcontractor(s) shall presume that the VA computer systems and storage media that the contractor or subcontractor access have sensitive information and applications, the modification or disclosure of which could cause significant harm or embarrassment to VA beneficiaries and employees and to VA's ability to perform its mission. If the security requirements for accessing, handling, and storing VA data and systems are specified in the contract, the contractor will comply with the contractual security requirements. If the contract does not contain the requirements, the contractor will handle the VA property with the same degree of care, but no less than a reasonable degree of care, to prevent the unauthorized access, use, dissemination, publication, or destruction that the contractor uses to protect its own sensitive information and systems.\nb. Any VA information, software, applications, computer systems, and hardware accessed by the contractor in the performance of the contract remain the sole property of VA.\nc. To the extent that any software or applications on the VA systems are protected by copyright, the contractor agrees that it will not copy or disclose them without first obtaining VA's prior written authorization, which will be provided only where authorized under applicable copyright law.\nd. The contractor, the contractor's employees, and any subcontractor and subcontractor's employees will access the VA information, software, applications, computer systems, and hardware which VA provides, or provides access to, only to the extent necessary, and only for the purpose of performing the contract. The contractor will take reasonable steps to ensure that it will allow only those contractor and subcontractor employees who need to see the VA materials in order to perform the contract to do so. However, this agreement also applies to any other VA systems or data to which the contractor may have access to or be disclosed to the contractor.\ne. The contractor will not authorize anyone else to access, disclose, modify, or destroy the information, software or applications on the VA systems provided or accessed under this contract without VA's prior written authorization.\nf. The contractor and its employees shall not make any copies of any VA information, including software or applications that are not copyrighted, except as necessary to restore VA computer systems or data storage devices to an operating state. Any copies made by the contractor or subcontractor shall be identified as VA property and handled as sensitive information under this non-disclosure agreement.\ng. Any information that the contractor and its employees learns about VA data and VA computer systems shall not be recorded except to the extent necessary to perform the contract, and such information, whether recorded or not, shall be handled as sensitive information under this agreement. The contractor may not use or disclose it except as the contractor is permitted to use or disclose VA sensitive information under the contract and this nondisclosure agreement.\nh. The contractor may disclose VA sensitive information to persons other than in the performance of this contract as authorized by the contract and this agreement in only two situations: (1) pursuant to an order of a court of competent jurisdiction; or (2) with VA's prior written authorization. Prior to any disclosure pursuant to a court order, the contractor shall promptly notify VA of the court order and provide VA with a copy by fax or e-mail, whichever is faster, and notify by telephone the VA individual designated in advance to receive such notices. If the contractor cannot notify VA before being compelled to produce the information under court order, the contractor will notify VA of the disclosure as soon as practical. The notice under this provision will include the following information to the extent that the contractor knows it, if it does not show on the face of the court order: the records disclosed pursuant to the order, to whom, where, and when, for what purpose, and any other information that the contractor reasonably believes is relevant to the disclosure.\ni. The contractor will refer all requests or demands for production of , or access to, VA data and systems to VA for response. The contractor will immediately inform VA by telephone, fax and/or e-mail of any access, disclosure, disposition or destruction of VA data and systems not authorized under the contract or this agreement. To the extent known, the contractor will notify VA of the information disclosed, to whom, how when, the reason for the access, disclosure, disposition or destruction, and any other information that the contractor considers relevant. VA will provide the contractor with the name, title, telephone number, fax number, and e-mail address of the VA official whom the contractor will notify if the records are requested, sought under a court order, or if any unauthorized access, modification, disposition, or destruction of VA sensitive information or computer systems occurs.\nj. The contractor, its employees, and its subcontractors and their employees will cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority response for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any unauthorized access, disclosure, disposition, or destruction of VA property. The contractor will also cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA property, to obtain monetary or other compensation for a third party, or to obtain injunctive relief against any third party who accessed, modified, disclosed, or destroyed VA sensitive data and computer systems except as authorized under the contract or this agreement.\nk. Upon completion or termination of the contract for any reason, the contractor will immediately deliver all VA records, data, copies of VA records and data, software and equipment, and information about VA data and systems recorded or documented by the contractor, in its possession or the possession of any subcontractors, to the VA official designated in the contract or pursuant to this agreement. The contractor will not retain any copies of any of these documents.\nl. All additions to, or modifications of, this agreement must be in writing and signed by both parties.\nm. This agreement is made under, and shall be governed by, the laws of the United States.\n4. SECURITY\na. Contractor personnel performing work under this contract shall satisfy all requirements for appropriate security eligibility in dealing with access to sensitive information and information systems belonging to or being used on behalf of VA. To satisfy VA requirements, procedures defined in VA Directive & Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program are required.\nb. The investigative history for contractor personnel working under this contract must be maintained in the databases of either the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) or the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Organization (DISCO). Should the contractor use a vendor other than OPM or Defense Security Service (DSS) to conduct investigations, the investigative company must be certified by OPM/DSS to conduct contractor investigations.\nc. All costs associated with obtaining clearances for contractor provided personnel will be the responsibility of the contractor. Further, the contractor will be responsible for the actions of all individuals provided to work for VA under this contract. In the event that damages arise from work performed by contractor provided personnel, under the auspices of this contract, the contractor will be responsible for all resources necessary to remedy the incident.\n5. SOFTWARE PROGRAM INTEGRITY\nThe contractor warrants and represents that the contractor-supplied software, other than the key software, does not and will not contain any program routine, device, code, or instructions (including any code or instructions provided by third parties) or other undisclosed feature, including, without limitation, a time bomb, virus, software lock, drop-dead device, malicious logic, worm, Trojan horse, bug, error, defect, or trap door, that is capable of accessing, modifying, deleting, damaging, disabling, deactivating, interfering with or otherwise harming the contractor software, any computers, networks, data, or other electronically stored information, or computer programs or systems (collectively, \"disabling procedures\"). Such representation and warranty applies regardless of whether such disabling procedures are authorized by the contractor to be included in the contractor software.\nIf the contractor incorporates into the contractor software programs or routines supplied by other vendors, licensors, or contractors (other than the key software), the contractor shall obtain comparable warranties from such providers, or the contractor shall take appropriate action to ensure that such programs or routines are free of disabling procedures. Notwithstanding any other limitations in this agreement, the contractor agrees to notify VA immediately upon discovery of any disabling procedures that are or may be included in the contractor software. If disabling procedures are discovered or reasonably suspect to be present in the contractor software, the contractor, as its entire liability and VA's sole and exclusive remedy for the breach of the warranty in this section, agrees to take action immediately, at its own expense, to identify and eradicate (or to equip VA to identify and eradicate) such disabling procedures and carry out any recovery necessary to remedy any impact of such disabling procedures.\nFederal Acquisition Regulation clause 52.246-18, Warranty of Supplies of a Complex Nature (May 2001), is hereby incorporated into VA Form 0752.\n(a) Definitions. As used in this clause - \"Acceptance\" means the act of an authorized representative of the Government by which the Government assumes for itself, or as an agent of another, ownership of existing and identified supplies, or approves specific services rendered, as partial or complete performance of the contract. \"Supplies\" means the end items furnished by the Contractor and related services required under this contract. The word does not include \"data.\"\n(b) Contractor's obligations. (1) The Contractor warrants that for two years all supplies furnished under this contract will be free from defects in material and workmanship and will conform with all requirements of this contract; provided, however, that with respect to Government-furnished property, the Contractor's warranty shall extend only to its proper installation, unless the Contractor performs some modification or other work on the property, in which case the Contractor's warranty shall extend to the modification or other work. (2) Any supplies or parts thereof corrected or furnished in replacement shall be subject to the conditions of this clause to the same extent as supplies initially delivered. This warranty shall be equal in duration to that set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause and shall run from the date of delivery of the corrected or replaced supplies. (3) The Contractor shall not be obligated to correct or replace supplies if the facilities, tooling, drawings, or other equipment or supplies necessary to accomplish the correction or replacement have been made unavailable to the Contractor by action of the Government. In the event that correction or replacement has been directed, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer, in writing, of the nonavailability. (4) The Contractor shall also prepare and furnish to the Government data and reports applicable to any correction required (including revision and updating of all affected data called for under this contract) at no increase in the contract price. (5) When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation costs from the place of delivery specified in the contract (irrespective of the f.o.b. point or the point of acceptance) to the Contractor's plant and return. (6) All implied warranties of merchant ability and \"fitness for a particular purpose\" are excluded from any obligation contained in this contract. (c) Remedies available to the Government. (1) In the event of a breach of the Contractor's warranty in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause, the Government may, at no increase in contract price - (i) Require the Contractor, at the place of delivery specified in the contract (irrespective of the f.o. b. point or the point of acceptance) or at the Contractor's plant, to repair or replace, at the Contractor's election, defective or nonconforming suppies; or (ii) Require the Contractor to furnish at the Contractor's plant the materials or parts and installation instructions required to successfully accomplish the correction. (2) If the Contracting Officer does not require correction or replacment of defective or nonconforming supplies or the Contractor is not obligated to correct or replace under paragraph (b)(3) of this clause, the Government shall be entitled to an equitable reduction in the contract price. (3) The Contracting Officer shall notify the Contractor in writing of any breach of the warranty in paragraph (b) of this clause within 45 days after discovery of the defect or intrusion. The Contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer a written recommendation within 5 work days as to the corrective action required to remedy the breach. After the notice of breach, but not later than 10 work days after receipt of the Contractor's recommendation for corrective action, the Contracting Officer may, in writing, direct correction or replacement as in paragraph (c)(1) of this clause, and the Contractor shall, notwithstanding any disagreement regarding the existence of a breach of warranty, comply with this direction. If it is later determined that the Contractor did not breach the warranty in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause, the contract price will be equitably adjusted. (4) If supplies are corrected or replaced, the period for notification of a breach of the Contractor's warranty in paragraph (c)(3) of this clause shall be two years from the furnishing or return by the Contractor to the Government of the corrected or replaced supplies or parts thereof, or, if correction or replacement is effect by the Contractor at a Government or other activity, for two years thereafter. (5) The rights and remedies of the Government provided in this clause are in addition to and do not limit any rights afforded to the Government by any other clause of the contract.\nDEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS CONTRACTOR\nSIGNATURE DATE SIGNATURE DATE\nPRINT NAME PRINT NAME\nPRINT TITLE PRINT TITLE\n",

Introduction\n1.1 The Parties wish to explore a possible co-operation regarding [brief description]. The Parties may during the evaluations, discussions and negotiations disclose to each other essential information regarding its operations, which they consider to be confidential.\n1.2 The Parties acknowledge that this confidential information is an essential part of the Disclosing Party\u2019s operations and the result of an unauthorised disclosure thereof will be a damaged competitive situation for the Disclosing Party, commercially and/or academically. The Parties therefore agree that the disclosure and use of the Confidential Information shall be made on the terms and conditions of this Agreement.\n2. Confidentiality and Non-Use\n2.1 For the purpose of this Agreement, \u201cConfidential Information\u201d means any information received by a Party (the \u201cReceiving Party\u201d) regarding the other Party\u2019s (the \u201cDisclosing Party\u201d) business, research, products and/or services, such as all information and technology, including without limitation, research, inventions, manufacture methods, data, designs, plans, drawings, know-how, IT systems, software, processes, schematics, blueprints, records, reports, models, prototypes and descriptions related thereto, customers, partners, as well as the terms and conditions of this Agreement and information furnished during discussions or oral presentations, whether or not designated as confidential at the time of disclosure.\n2.2 Confidential Information shall not include information that:\ni. is or becomes part of the public domain through no fault or breach on the part of Receiving Party;\nii. was previously known to the Receiving Party free of any obligation to keep it confidential, as evidenced by its business records;\niii. is lawfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party; or\niv. is independently developed by the Receiving Party without the use of any Confidential Information, as evidenced by its records.\n2.3 This Agreement will not be deemed to restrict either Party from complying with a lawfully issued governmental order, order of a court of competent jurisdiction or other legal requirement to produce or disclose Confidential Information; provided, however, that the Receiving Party will promptly notify the Disclosing Party upon learning of such order or requirement.\n2.4 The Parties shall only use Confidential Information for the purpose of negotiation and/or evaluation of any co-operation between the Parties. The Parties shall not disclose Confidential Information to any third party, other than to their officers, employees or consultants (engaged in the matter of this Agreement) on a need to know basis, without the prior written approval of the other Party.

The Receiving Party shall not be entitled to copy any Confidential Information furnished by the Disclosing Party hereunder, unless and to the extent it is necessary for the purpose of this Agreement. Upon request of the Disclosing Party or upon the termination of this Agreement, the Receiving Party shall return, delete or destroy (as instructed in writing by the Disclosing Party) all Confidential Information, and all copies thereof. The Receiving Party shall certify in writing that the information has been returned, deleted or destroyed (as applicable) and that no copies have been retained of any such Confidential Information, either partly or wholly.\n4.

This Agreement shall remain in force and effect for [one (1)] year when duly signed by both Parties, provided, however that the confidentiality obligations imposed on the Receiving Party under this Agreement shall continue for a period of [five (5)] years after termination of the Agreement, except to the extent this Agreement is superseded by stipulations of a contemplated agreement. The provisions of this Agreement shall apply retroactively to any Confidential Information, which has been disclosed in accordance with this Agreement and in connection with discussions and negotiation regarding the possible co-operation described in this Agreement prior to the effective date of the Agreement.\n7. Assignment\n7.1 Neither Party shall have the right to assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party.\n8.

      "text": "MUTUAL NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nThis Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement ('Agreement\") is made and entered into as of __________, 20__ (\"Effective Date\") by and between ______________________________ (\u201cProducer\u201d) and___________________________________, (\u201cAgency\u201d) (each a \"Party\" and collectively referred to herein as the \"Parties\").\nFor purposes of this Agreement \u201cAgency\u201d means the undersigned Advertising Agency, \u201cClient\u201d means the advertiser client of the Agency identified on the signature page of this Agreement; \u201cCommercial\u201d means a commercial production referred to in the Producer\u2019s bid/specification form. The term \u201cAgency Affiliate\u201d means (i) the wholly owned subsidiary of the Agency\u2019s parent (\u201cOwner\u201d) where the Agency is also a wholly owned subsidiary (ii) which Agency Affiliate is an advertising agency and does not operate as a commercial production, post production business or acts as an in-house cost consulting entity. Agency represents that it is soliciting bona fide bids for the production of the Commercial and Producer represents that its bid, if submitted, shall be a bona fide bid. If the terms and conditions of this Agreement are inconsistent with those in Client\u2019s or Agency\u2019s bid/specification form, production agreement or purchase order that address the subject matter of this Agreement, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control. Agency is signing this Agreement for itself and for its Client who is also a \u201cParty,\u201d \u201cRecipient\u201d and \u201cDiscloser\u201d under this Agreement.\nNow, therefore, the Parties agree as follows:\n1. Confidential Information. Each Party receiving Confidential Information (as defined below) (each, a \"Recipient,\" and together, the \"Recipients\"), is receiving confidential disclosure of certain confidential or proprietary technical, business, operational, financial and/or commercial information, trade secret information and/or any information of the other designated as \u201cConfidential\u201d, \u201cProprietary\u201d or by similar designation, or which under the circumstances surrounding disclosure ought to be treated as confidential (\"Confidential Information\") for the purpose of exploring, establishing, performing or carrying out a contractual business relationship for the production by the Producer of the Commercial and/or other commercial productions for the Client (collectively and severally, the \u201cTransaction\"). Each disclosing Party (each a \"Discloser\") would not disclose its Confidential Information without the Recipient's agreement to maintain the Confidential Information in confidence and to use such Confidential Information solely as permitted under this Agreement. Confidential Information can be in any form (e.g. electronic, digital, analog, hard copy or oral). Nothing in this Agreement shall require a Party to disclose its Confidential Information.\nSpecifically, with respect to the Producer, the term \u201cConfidential Information\u201d includes confidential and proprietary information of Producer disclosed in connection with the Transaction (during each phase including pre-production, conference(s), pre-bid, bid, production, shoot, wrap and post-production) and regardless of whether a commercial production project is awarded to Producer, including, but not limited to, production costs, discounts, bids, budgets, treatments, prices, relationships with employees, independent contractors and vendors, specifications, sources, layouts, breakdowns, approach to a commercial project, financial and technical information, ideas, designs, specifications, techniques, models, data, programs, processes, technologies and methods of producing the work, all customized terms of, and attachments to, the Producer\u2019s bid/specification form or production contract or other production documents, processes, know-how, customer lists, marketing plans, systems and reports, and information discussed by Producer at any Agency or Client meetings.\n2. Non-Use and Non-Disclosure. Recipients will not disclose, distribute, copy or use any Confidential Information or the fact that a Transaction is being considered or is under a production contract without the prior written consent of the other Party and then only to the extent specified in such consent. Confidential Information may be used only to the extent reasonably required for the purposes of evaluating, producing or carrying out the Transaction; provided however, that Recipients may only disclose the Confidential Information to those of its contractors, vendors, directors, officers, advisors, agents and employees (\"Representatives\") who need to know such Confidential Information for the purpose of evaluating, performing or carrying out or producing the Transaction and who shall be bound by a written agreement or other legally enforceable written obligations to preserve the confidentiality of the Confidential Information in a manner consistent with this Agreement. The Recipient will be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by it or its Representatives, whether or not such Representatives are associated with the Discloser at the time of the breach.\nWithout limiting the foregoing, where the Discloser is the Producer and a Recipient Representative is a cost consultant of the Client or Agency, the Recipient shall secure its Representative\u2019s express written agreement that it will not make any business or other use of, and will in perpetuity hold in confidence, all Confidential Information acquired or learned by such Representative and shall not use or disclose such information except as permitted in this Agreement. Prohibited uses and disclosures by such Representative include, but are not limited to, uses for or disclosures to a competitor of the Producer and uses for or disclosures to any other client or prospective client of such Representative, regardless of whether the Confidential Information is aggregated with other information or its not identified with the Producer.\nProducer Confidential Information may be disclosed to the Owner (unless an independent third party is required by the FTC/DOJ) for purposes permitted under this Agreement and disclosed, on an aggregate basis, to other Agency Affiliates provided: (i) the Owner and each Agency Affiliate Recipient agrees to be bound by this Agreement; (ii) Producer Confidential Information to be disclosed is at least three months old; (iii) Producer Confidential Information is aggregated with similar types of confidential information of at least 4 other commercial producers with whom the Agency or Agency Affiliate have contracted to produce commercials and who have consented in writing to have their confidential information aggregated and disclosed in accordance with this procedure provided however that no aggregated producer confidential information represents more than 25% on a weighted basis of any statistic and further provided that all information is sufficiently aggregated such that it would not allow a Recipient to identify the Confidential Information of the Producer or of any other producer whose confidential information is aggregated.\nThe obligations of confidentiality in this Agreement do not extend to any item of Confidential Information which (i) is publicly known at the time of its disclosure, (ii) is lawfully received by a Recipient from a third party not known to the Recipient to be under a similar confidential agreement to this Agreement or under obligation of confidentiality to the Discloser, (iii) is published or otherwise made known to the public by the Discloser of Confidential Information, (iv) was generated independently by the receiving Recipient without reliance on Confidential Information (as proven by supporting documentation evidencing such independent generation) or (v) was received either prior to the Effective Date of this Agreement or was received for the first time only after the termination or expiration of this Agreement.\n3. Maintenance of Confidentiality. Recipient agrees that it shall take reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure and unauthorized use of the Confidential Information. Without limiting the foregoing, Recipient shall take at least those measures that it takes to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature, but in no event less than reasonable measures. Recipient shall reproduce Discloser's proprietary rights notices on any copies, in the same manner in which such notices were set forth in or on the original. Recipient shall immediately notify Discloser upon discovery of any loss or unauthorized disclosure of any Confidential Information.\nIf the Recipient receives a request to disclose all or any part of the Confidential Information under the terms of a valid subpoena or order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or governmental body, Recipient agrees to (i) immediately notify the Discloser of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding such a request, so that the Discloser may seek an appropriate protective order or other reliable written assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to Confidential Information, and (ii) only disclose that portion of the Confidential Information which counsel advises is legally required to be disclosed. At all times, the Discloser shall retain sole ownership of its Confidential Information.\n4. Return of Materials. At the request of the Discloser, Recipient will promptly return to the Discloser or at Discloser\u2019s instructions destroy any written or electronic Confidential Information and all physical media on which Confidential Information was received from the other Recipient, including any copies thereof, with a letter confirming that the Confidential Information has not been reproduced or copied or that all copies have been returned and that none of the Confidential Information was disclosed to anyone except in accordance with this Agreement. The Recipient and its Representatives shall not retain any copies, extracts or other reproductions, in whole or in part, of such written or electronic material, except as may be needed to comply with applicable law and, provided that Recipient may retain one copy of Confidential Information in its confidential files for use only in the event a dispute arises between the Parties hereunder and only in connection with that dispute.\n5. No Warranty. All confidential information is provided \"as is\" and Disclosers make no warranties of any kind, express, implied or otherwise, regarding the accuracy, utility, completeness or performance of any Confidential Information.\n6. No License. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to grant any rights to the Recipient in any copyrights or other intellectual property of the Discloser, nor shall this Agreement grant any Party any proprietary rights in or to the Confidential Information of the other Party.\n7. Term. Recipient's obligations under this Agreement with respect to disclosures of Confidential Information made hereunder shall expire five (5) years from the date this Agreement is executed by the Parties.\n8. Remedies. Each Recipient acknowledges that a violation of this Agreement would cause irreparable harm to the Discloser for which no adequate remedy at law exists and each Recipient therefore agrees that, in addition to any other remedies available, both Parties will be entitled to seek injunctive relief to enforce the terms of this Agreement without a requirement that Discloser prove irreparable harm or provide the posting of a bond.\n9. Miscellaneous. The terms of this Agreement may be modified or waived only by a separate writing signed by the Parties expressly so modifying or waiving such terms. No failure or delay by the Discloser in exercising any right, power or privilege shall operate as a waiver, nor shall any single or partial exercise preclude any other or further exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder. The unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision. This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their successors and assigns. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of ____________________ without giving effect to any conflicts or choice of laws provisions that would cause the application of the domestic substantive laws of any other jurisdiction. This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and neither Party shall have any obligation, express or implied by law, with respect to trade secret or proprietary information of the other Party except as set forth herein. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, with each an original and both of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument, and the Parties agree that they will be bound by electronic signatures. The Parties expressly agree and acknowledge that any disputes relating to this Agreement will be exclusively adjudicated by federal and state courts located in_______________________.\nEach person who signs this Agreement represents that he/she has the authority and is empowered to sign and deliver this Agreement on behalf of the Recipient that he/she represents. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have executed this Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement as of the date first set forth above.\nPRODUCER\nBy: __________________________________________\nName: ________________________________________\nTitle: _________________________________________\nAddress: ______________________________________\n______________________________________________\nAGENCY FOR ITSELF AND ITS\nADVERTISER/CLIENT\nBy: __________________________________________\nName: ________________________________________\nTitle: _________________________________________\nAddress: ______________________________________\n______________________________________________\nADVERTISER/CLIENT OF AGENCY\nAS IDENTIFIED TO PRODUCER BY\nAGENCY:\nName of Client: __________________________________________\nAddress of Client: ________________________________________\n_______________________________________________________\nContact Person: __________________________________________\n",

      "text": "MUTUAL NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nTHIS AGREEMENT between _ , a corporation having offices at ( Company ), and AMPHENOL Tuchel Industrial GmbH, (\u201cAmphenol\u201d), is effective as\nWHEREAS, for the purpose stated in Section 2 below, Company and Amphenol (collectively referred to as the \u201cParties\u201d and individually referred to as a \u201cParty\u201d) have determined to establish terms governing the use and protection of Confidential Information (as defined in Section 1 below) that one Party (\u201cOwner\u201d) may disclose to the other Party (\u201cthe Recipient\u201d).\nNOW, THEREFORE, the Parties agree as follows:\n1. \u201cConfidential Information\u201d means information that relates to the purpose stated in Section 2 below that has been designated as proprietary by the disclosing party with an appropriate conspicuous stamp or legend on the document exchanged or, although not related to such purpose, is nevertheless disclosed, and that should reasonably have been understood by the Recipient, because of appropriate and conspicuous legends or other markings, to be proprietary and confidential to the Owner, an Affiliate of the Owner or to a third party. The term \u201cAffiliate\u201d means any person or entity directly or indirectly controlling controlled by, or under common control with a Party. Confidential Information may be disclosed in written or other tangible form (including magnetic media) or by oral, visual or other means. In addition, information and data disclosed orally shall be subject to the provisions of this Agreement provided; (a) the disclosing party clearly identifies the orally disclosed data as proprietary at the time of disclosure, and (b) such orally disclosed data is subsequently reduced to writing, marked with an appropriate stamp or legend and provided in writing as Confidential Information pursuant to Article 2 within ten (10) days of such oral disclosures.\n2. Confidential Information disclosed hereunder is intended to be used for the purpose of discussing the following general business opportunities: (the \u201cPurpose\u201d).\n3. The Recipient shall protect such Confidential Information from disclosure to others, using the same degree of care used to protect its own confidential or proprietary information of like importance, but in any case using no less than a reasonable degree of care. The Recipient may disclose Confidential Information received hereunder to (i) its Affiliates, to its employees and agents, and its Affiliates\u2019 employees and agents, who have a need to know the Confidential Information, and who agree to protect the Confidential Information from unauthorized use and disclosure. Confidential Information shall be used solely for the Purpose and shall not otherwise be disclosed to any third party without the prior written consent of the Owner.\n4. The restrictions of this Agreement on use and disclosure of Confidential Information shall not apply to information, which is:\n(a) in the public domain as of the date of this Agreement or which later comes into the domain from a source other than the Recipient;\n(b) in the Recipient\u2019s possession free of any obligation of confidence at the time of Owner\u2019s communication thereof to the Recipient;\n(c) developed by the Recipient independently of and without reference to any of the Owner\u2019s Confidential Information or other information that the Owner disclosed in confidence to any third party and there is tangible evidence to support such independent development;\n(d) rightfully obtained by the Recipient from third parties authorized to make such disclosure without restriction; or\n(e) approved for release by prior written authorization of the Owner.\n5. In the event the Recipient is required by law, regulation or court order to disclose any of the Owner\u2019s Confidential Information, the Recipient will promptly notify the Owner in writing prior to making any such disclosure in order to facilitate seeking a protective order by the Owner or other appropriate remedy from the proper authority. The Recipient agrees to cooperate with the Owner in seeking such order or other remedy. The Recipient further agrees that if the Owner is not successful in precluding the requesting legal body from requiring the disclosure of the Confidential Information, it will furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information, which it is legally required, and it will exercise all reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded the Confidential Information.\n6. All Confidential Information disclosed under this Agreement (including without limitation, information in computer software or held in electronic storage media) shall be and remain the property of the Owner. All such Confidential Information in tangible form shall be returned to the Owner promptly upon written request or the termination or expiration of this Agreement, and shall not thereafter be retained in any form by the Recipient, its Affiliates, or any employees or independent contractors of the Recipient or its Affiliates. The Recipient shall also certify to the Owner the timely destruction of all copies of Confidential Information and all notes and memoranda, in whatever form maintained, incorporating any Confidential Information.\nThe Parties\u2019 representatives primarily responsible for coordinating disclosure and receipt of Confidential Information and further responsible for destruction and/or return of Confidential Information, upon termination of this Agreement are:\nIf to Amphenol:\nName:\nTitle:\nAddress:\nTelephone:\nFacsimile:\nIf to:\nName:\nTitle:\nAddress:\nTelephone:\nFacsimile:\nAny notice required or contemplated by this Agreement shall be given in writing to the individuals whose names are set forth above either via hand delivery or by confirmed facsimile transmission or by Federal Express or comparable overnight carrier.\n7. No licenses or rights under any patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret are granted or are to be implied by this Agreement. Neither Party shall be obligated by this Agreement to disclose any Confidential Information which it does not wish to disclose or to enter into any other agreement or transaction or to purchase from or provide to the other Party any service or product.\n8. The Owner represents that it has the authority to disclose to the Recipient any Confidential Information, which it elects to disclose hereunder. The Owner shall not, however, have any liability or responsibility for errors or omissions in, or any decisions made by the Recipient in reliance on, any Confidential Information disclosed under this Agreement.\n9. Each party agrees to protect Confidential Information received from the other by exercising, at a minimum, the same level of care it uses to protect its own confidential information and agrees that it will (a) use such Confidential Information only for the purposes of this Agreement; (b) only make such Confidential Information available to its employees having a \u201cneed to know\u201d; (c) not disclose the Confidential Information to any third person, except that Confidential Information may be disclosed to the demand of the Government (d) not copy or reproduce Confidential Information in whole or in part, except as necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, provided that, if they do copy or reproduce Confidential Information in whole or in part, the reproduction shall carry a proprietary notice or legend similar to that which appears on the original; (e) not manufacture, sell, use, or have made devices embodying or utilizing Confidential Information, except as otherwise agreed to by the Parties in writing.\n10. Except as may be required by law or to enforce the terms hereof, neither Party shall disclose the existence or terms of this Agreement, or the substance of any discussions or negotiations covered by this Agreement.\n11. The Parties acknowledge that Confidential Information is unique and valuable, and that disclosure in breach of this Agreement may result in irreparable injury to Owner for which monetary damages alone may not be an adequate remedy. Therefore, the Parties agree that in the event of a breach or threatened breach of confidentiality, the Owner shall be entitled to specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief as a remedy for any such breach or anticipated breach without the necessity of posting a bond. Any such relief shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any appropriate relief in the way of monetary damages.\n12. Neither Party shall assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder, except to an Affiliate or successor in interest, without the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.\n13. No failure or delay in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder.\n14. This Agreement: (a) is the complete agreement of the Parties concerning the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior such agreements with respect to further disclosures concerning such subject matter; (b) may not be amended or in any manner modified except by a written instrument signed by authorized representatives of both Parties; and (c) shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Germany without regard to its choice of law provisions.\n15. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable, the remainder shall be enforced as fully as possible and the unenforceable provision shall be deemed modified to the limited extent required to permit its enforcement in a manner most closely representing the intention of the Parties as expressed herein.\n16. In addition to all remedies available in law and equity, a party who breaches or attempts to breach this Agreement shall be liable to the other party for all legal fees and costs incurred in the successful enforcement of this Agreement or the successful establishment of breach of this Agreement.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the Parties hereto has caused this Agreement to be executed by its duly authorized representative.\nAMPHENOL Tuchel Industrial GmbH\nBy: By:\nSignature _______________________ Signature _______________________\nBy: By:\nPrinted Name: Printed Name:\nTitle: Title:\nDated: Dated:\n",

      "text": "NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nThis Non-Disclosure Agreement (the \u201cNDA\u201d) is effective 23 August, 2019 (the \u201cEffective Date\u201d) and governs the disclosure of Confidential Information (\u201cCI\u201d, as defined below) between the Adobe entity identified below, including entities that it directly or indirectly controls or is under common control with (collectively \u201cAdobe\u201d), and the party identified below, including entities that it directly or indirectly controls or is under common control with (collectively \u201cCompany\u201d). The party disclosing CI is referred to as \u201cDiscloser\u201d and the party receiving CI is referred to as \u201cRecipient\u201d. Company and Adobe may make disclosures of CI to each other for discussions, evaluation, or consultations, concerning their prospective or existing business relationship (the Purpose).\n1. Definition. CI means Discloser\u2019s non-public written information, in any form, and all copies, summaries and extracts which is identified in writing as confidential at the time of disclosure, and any information disclosed in non-tangible form that is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure and summarized in a writing labelled as \u201cconfidential\u201d delivered to Recipient within 15 days after disclosure. CI does not include information that (A) is or becomes generally publicly available at the time of disclosure or subsequently through no fault of Recipient, (B) was known to Recipient, free of any confidentiality obligations, before its disclosure by Discloser, (C) becomes known to Recipient, free of any confidentiality obligations, from a source other than Discloser, or (D) is independently developed by Recipient without use of CI.\n2. Confidentiality Obligations. Recipient will not reproduce, use, disseminate, or disclose CI to any person or entity, except to its employees and authorized representatives (i.e., temporary employees, consultants, and contractors) who need to know the CI to further the Purpose and are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as this NDA before having access to the CI. Recipient is responsible for any breach of this NDA by any of its representatives. Recipient will not modify, reverse engineer, create other works from, or disassemble any software programs contained in the CI without Discloser\u2019s prior written consent. Recipient will treat all CI with at least the same degree of care as it treats its own information of similar sensitivity, but never with less than reasonable care. Recipient will stop use of and return or destroy all tangible CI promptly upon request, together with any copies, except as otherwise required by law. Recipient may disclose CI (A) as approved in a writing signed by Discloser or (B) as necessary to respond to a valid order by a court or other governmental body, as required by law, or as necessary to establish the rights of either party, provided that Recipient promptly notifies Discloser upon receipt of the disclosure order and requests confidential treatment of any affected CI.\n3. No Other Rights. All Discloser CI remains the property of Discloser. Unless expressly set forth in this NDA, Recipient does not receive any license or intellectual property rights to Discloser\u2019s CI. Each party agrees that Recipient (A) may independently develop and acquire software, hardware, and other technology for its own products, services, and processes, and that having access to Discloser\u2019s CI does not prohibit Recipient from freely developing or acquiring similar products without obligation to Discloser; and (B) is free to use the residuals of CI for any purpose, where \u201cresiduals\u201d means that CI disclosed in non-tangible form that may be retained in the memories of representatives of Recipient.\n4. Termination. Either party may terminate this NDA upon 10 days\u2019 written notice. However, all CI provided under this NDA will remain subject to the terms of this NDA.\n5. General. All CI is provided \u201cAS IS\u201d and all warranties, express, implied, or otherwise are disclaimed. Any attempt to transfer all or part of a party\u2019s rights or obligations under this NDA without the prior written consent of the other party will be null and void. This NDA may only be modified by mutual written agreement signed by authorized representatives of the parties. This NDA contains the complete agreement between the parties as to the subject matter, and replaces and supersedes any other communications, or agreements, whether oral or written concerning the subject matter. Regardless of conflict of laws principles, this NDA is governed by and construed in accordance with the substantive laws in force in the State of California. The parties will comply with all applicable export laws and regulations in their use and disclosure of CI. This NDA may be executed in counterparts and may be signed electronically or with handwritten signatures. The English language version of this NDA will be the version used if any dispute arises.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this NDA through their authorized representatives as of the Effective Date.\nAdobe Inc.

When Champion or Company receives Confidential Information (as defined herein) from the other party, it is a \u201creceiving party\u201d hereunder, and when Champion or Company discloses Confidential Information to the other party, it is a \u201cdisclosing party\u201d hereunder.\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained in this Agreement and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby agree as follows:\n1. Confidential Information. \u201cConfidential Information\u201d means confidential and proprietary information (regardless of whether such Confidential Information is in written, oral, visual or electronic form) (a) that consists of Trade Secrets (as hereinafter defined), discoveries, technical, engineering, financial, pricing and/or other business data and documentation, sales information, inventions, know-how, manufacturing techniques and specifications, process technologies, business plans, all disclosed by the disclosing party in furtherance of the purpose set forth in Section 2; (b) regarding the current and/or prospective business of the disclosing party; or (c) that is marked as confidential, proprietary or privileged by the disclosing party. \u201cTrade Secrets\u201d means any business or technical information (including but not limited to a formula, pattern, program, device, compilation of information, method, technique, or process) that derives independent actual or potential commercial value from not being generally known or readily ascertainable through independent development or through reverse engineering by persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, and that is the subject of efforts reasonable under the circumstances to maintain the secrecy thereof. The existence of a Trade Secret will not be negated merely because the information comprising the Trade Secret has also been developed and used by or owned independently by more than one person, or has been licensed to any other persons.\n2.

The Receiving Party further acknowledges that, as a condition to receiving any documentation and/or information relating to the Transaction, the Receiving Party is required to conclude this Agreement and bind itself to the undertakings herein.\n2.5 The Receiving Party acknowledges and agrees that, to the extent that it intends to participate in the Transaction as part of a joint venture or consortium, each member of such joint venture or consortium will be required to submit a signed confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement, on the same terms and conditions as those set out in this Agreement, before any information or documentation relating to the Transaction will be distributed to any of its members, including the Receiving Party.\n2.6 The Parties accordingly agree as set out herein.\n3 TERM OF AGREEMENT\nThis Agreement will commence on the Signature Date and shall remain binding and in force for a period of five years thereafter or such longer period as the Parties may agree to in writing (\"Term\").\n4 RECEIVING PARTY'S UNDERTAKINGS\n4.1 For purposes of this Agreement, the term \"Affiliate\" shall mean any person which either directly or indirectly controls, is directly or indirectly controlled by, or is under common control with a Party and, for purposes of this definition, a person shall be deemed to \"control\" an entity if it owns or has the ability to vote, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the voting securities or equivalent interest of that entity and a reference to an Affiliate shall include a reference to such Affiliate's employees, officers, directors, representatives and advisers.\n4.2 The Receiving Party acknowledges that the unauthorised use or disclosure of any Confidential Information disclosed by the Disclosing Party may give rise to substantial damage to the Disclosing Party. Accordingly, the Receiving Party hereby undertakes to the Disclosing Party that, for as long as this Agreement remains in force, it will (and it will procure that its employees, officers, directors, representatives, advisers and any Affiliate to which it discloses the Confidential Information will) \u2013\n4.2.1 treat as confidential all Confidential Information;\n4.2.2 protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information in the same manner and with the same degree of care that a reasonable man would use to protect his own confidential information;\n4.2.3 not use, exploit or in any other manner whatsoever apply or reproduce the Confidential Information except to the extent required to achieve the Purpose;\n4.2.4 not divulge or permit access to the Confidential Information to any person except to those of its employees, officers, directors, representatives, advisers and Affiliates who have a specific need to know such information in relation to the Transaction. Before revealing any Confidential Information to its employees, officers, directors, representatives, advisers and/or Affiliates, the Receiving Party shall be obliged to notify such employees, officers, directors, representatives, advisers and/or Affiliates of the confidential nature of the disclosure and ensure that such employees, officers, directors, representatives, advisers and/or Affiliates are obliged not to disclose the Confidential Information to any unauthorised third party and not use the Confidential Information except as may be strictly required in relation to the Transaction. The Receiving Party shall be liable for any damages incurred by the Disclosing Party as a result of any unauthorised disclosure of the Confidential Information made by the Receiving Party, its employees, officers, directors, representatives and/or Affiliates; and\n4.2.5 immediately notify the Disclosing Party in writing if it becomes aware that there has been an unauthorised disclosure or use of any Confidential Information and take all necessary steps to recover such Confidential Information and to prevent any further disclosure of such Confidential Information.\n4.3 All information furnished or disclosed by the Disclosing Party to the Receiving Party shall be deemed to be Confidential Information unless the Receiving Party can demonstrate the contrary.\n4.4 The Receiving Party agrees that monetary damages may not be a sufficient remedy for a breach of the undertakings given by it in this 4 and accordingly, without prejudice to any other rights and remedies available to the Disclosing Party, agrees that the Disclosing Party shall, in the event of a breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement, be entitled to seek relief by way of interdict, specific performance or otherwise.\n4.5 Should the Receiving Party or any of its employees, officers, directors, representatives, advisers or Affiliates be obliged by any law, or a valid order of any court of competent jurisdiction or government authority acting with the powers granted to it in law, to disclose any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to any third party, the Receiving Party shall, prior to making any such disclosure \u2013\n4.5.1 immediately notify the Disclosing Party in writing of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding such request, so that the Disclosing Party may seek an interdict or other appropriate remedy to limit the scope of any such disclosure;\n4.5.2 consult with the Disclosing Party on the advisability of taking legally available steps to resist or narrow such request and co-operate with the Disclosing Party in taking such steps as the Disclosing Party may reasonably require to resist or narrow any such request; and\n4.5.3 if disclosure of any Confidential Information is legally required, exercise all reasonable endeavours to obtain an order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be afforded to such portion of the Confidential Information as the Disclosing Party may designate.\n4.6 The Receiving Party shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that \u2013\n4.6.1 no unauthorised third party gains access to the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party which is in the possession or under the control of the Receiving Party, its employees, officers, directors, representatives, advisers or Affiliates; and\n4.6.2 the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party does not fall into the hands of an unauthorised third party.\n4.7 The Receiving Party shall ensure that its employees, officers, directors, representatives, advisers and Affiliates which may gain access to the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party are bound not to -\n4.7.1 disclose the Confidential Information to any third party;

No failure or delay by either Party to exercise any right, power or remedy will operate as a waiver of it nor will any partial exercise preclude any further exercise of the same, or of some other right, power or remedy.\n6.4 Without prejudice to any other rights or remedies that either Party may have, each Party acknowledges and agrees that damages alone may not be an adequate remedy for any breach by a Receiving Party or any Receiving Party Authorised Person of the provisions of this Agreement. Accordingly, each Party acknowledges that the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to the remedies of injunction and specific performance as well as any other equitable relief for any threatened or actual breach of this Agreement and/or breach of confidence and that no proof of special damages shall be necessary for the enforcement of such remedies.\n6.5 For the purposes of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 no one other than the Parties has the right to enforce the terms of this Agreement.\n6.6 Each Party will be responsible for all costs incurred by it or on its behalf in connection with this Agreement.\n6.7 This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by the Parties on separate counterparts, but shall not be effective until each Party has executed at least one counterpart. Each counterpart shall constitute an original of this Agreement, but all the counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.\n7 Notices\n7.1 Any notice to be given under this Agreement (each a \u201cNotice\u201d) shall be given in writing and shall be delivered by hand and shall be deemed to have been duly given at the time of delivery provided that such Notice is sent to the relevant physical address, and expressly marked for the attention of the relevant individual, set out in Clause 7.2.\n7.2 Any Notice:\n7.2.1 if to be given to the Authority shall be sent to:\n[Address]\nAttention: [Contact name and/or position, e.g. \u201cThe Finance Director\u201d]\n7.2.2 if to be given to the Organisation shall be sent to:\n[Name of Organisation]\n[Address]\nAttention: [ ]\n8 Governing law\n8.1 This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, English law and any matter claim or dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement whether contractual or non-contractual, shall be governed by and determined in accordance with English law.\n8.2 Each Party hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts in respect of any claim or dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement.\nIN WITNESS of the above this Agreement has been signed by the duly authorised representatives of the Parties on the date which appears at the head of page 1.\nFor and on behalf of the Authority\nSignature: ______________________________ Date:\nName: Position:\nFor and on behalf of the Organisation\nSignature: ______________________________ Date:\nName: Position:\n",

      "text": "BOMI International\nNON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nThis Non-Disclosure Agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) is made by and between BOMI International, Inc. (\u201cBOMI\u201d), and you, the test taker (\u201cAttendee\u201d). In consideration for your right to take the CBT Test, Attendee agrees to the following:\n1. \u201cConfidential Information\u201d shall mean all information, whether communicated in oral, written, electronic or other form, furnished by BOMI or prepared by Attendee during the Testing Period, including, but not limited to, answers and notes made by Attendee during the Testing Period, any test questions and answers, any accompanying Test materials and like information, and any and all other Test information of, or provided by, BOMI. All notes, analyses, compilations, and other documents prepared by Attendee during the Testing Period, which contain or otherwise reflect information regarding the Test, will also be \u201cConfidential Information.\u201d The Testing Period includes all time immediately prior to, during, and immediately following the scheduled Test time.\n2. Attendee will preserve as confidential all Confidential Information that Attendee may obtain or prepare in relation to the Test during the Testing Period. Without BOMI\u2019s prior written consent, which may be given or withheld by BOMI in its sole and absolute discretion, Attendee will not at any time, whether during or after the Testing Period, (a) disclose any Confidential Information to any third party nor give any third party access thereto, nor (b) use any Confidential Information except as required in taking the Test. At all times during the testing period, Attendee agrees to abide by the Code of Professional Ethics and Conduct, a copy of which can be found online at www.bomi.org.\n3. Attendee shall notify BOMI immediately upon discovery of unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information or any breach of this Agreement, and shall cooperate with BOMI in every reasonable way to assist BOMI in mitigating the consequences of such use or disclosure and preventing further unauthorized use or disclosure. If a third party brings an action against BOMI arising out of Attendee\u2019s breach of this Agreement, BOMI, at its sole discretion, may settle or defend the claim, and Attendee shall pay all settlements, costs, damages and legal fees and expenses arising out of such settlement or defense.\n4. Attendee agrees that money damages will not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by him and that in addition to all other remedies which may be available, BOMI will be entitled to specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief, without bond, as a remedy for any such breach or threatened breach. All remedies available to BOMI for breach of this Agreement are cumulative and may be exercised concurrently or separately, and the exercise of any one remedy shall not be deemed an election of such remedy to the exclusion of other remedies.\n5. In the event of any litigation between the Parties in connection with this Agreement, including the seeking of injunctive relief, if BOMI is the successful party, Attendee shall pay to BOMI therein all costs and expenses, including but not limited to actual attorneys\u2019 fees incurred therein by BOMI, which costs, expenses and attorneys\u2019 fees shall be included as a part of any judgment rendered in such action in addition to any other relief to which BOMI may be entitled. Should BOMI not be a successful party, the Parties will each bear their own attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses.\n6. Attendee acknowledges that all Test documents, materials, drawings, and other physical media of expression incorporating or containing any Confidential Information that BOMI furnishes to Attendee, or that Attendee prepares during the Testing Period, are BOMI\u2019s property and will be promptly surrendered to BOMI upon the completion of the Testing Period. After the completion of the Testing Period, Attendee will make no further use of any of the Confidential Information. The foregoing will apply regardless of whether Attendee completes the Test.\n7. Attendee understands that BOMI makes no representations or warranties as to the accuracy or completeness of any Confidential Information disclosed, and Attendee agrees that neither BOMI nor any of its officers, directors, Attendees, agents, members or attorneys will have any liability to Attendee arising from Attendee\u2019s use of the Confidential Information.\n8. To the fullest extent permitted by law, all of the covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement will survive indefinitely. Attendee also understands that the obligation not to use or disclose Confidential Information shall survive the completion of Testing Period, for so long as the information remains Confidential Information. Attendee further understands that this Agreement extends to, and shall be binding upon, his heirs, successors and assigns.\n9. This Agreement supersedes all previous agreements, written or oral, relating to the above subject matter, and may be modified only by a written instrument duly executed by the parties hereto. If any part of any provision of this Agreement or any other agreement, document or writing given pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement shall be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, said part shall be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability only, without in any way affecting the remaining parts of said provision or the remaining provisions of said agreement.\n10. This Agreement will be governed by and construed according to the laws of the State of Maryland (excluding the choice of laws rules thereof). Attendee hereby consents to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Maryland. Any suit brought hereon must be brought in the state or federal courts sitting in the State of Maryland, the parties hereto hereby waive any claim or defense that such forum is not convenient or proper.\n",

Preamble\nWhereas Fronius is involved in developing battery charging systems, welding systems, alternators and related technologies and their accessories;\nAnd whereas Fronius protects its intellectual property rights consistently via patents, other protected rights, confidentiality etc.\nAnd whereas Fronius as the DISCLOSER will, in the course of the business dealings established with the DISCLOSEE, provide confidential information (as defined in section 2 \"Subject matter of non-disclosure agreement\" and referred to hereinafter as 'confidential information);\nThis contract does not imply any commercial obligation between the parties of any kind (purchasing and selling products, joint ventures, partnerships, etc.). Any commercial relations must be agreed separately.\n2. Subject matter of non-disclosure agreement\n For the purposes of this non-disclosure agreement, the term 'confidential information' means information which is designated as 'confidential' or \u2013 where communicated orally \u2013 is designated as confidential or referred to similarly when communicated. Oral communications must be confirmed subsequently in writing.\nThe term 'confidential information' includes, but is not limited to, all documents, drawings, data, subjects, information, records, knowhow, protected rights, inventions, ideas, concepts, knowledge, technology, design, specifications, including dimensions, tolerances, materials and connections, blueprints, diagrams, software, improvements, production procedures, production processes, formulae, all documents and information concerning the company, in particular administrative and commercial facts and details concerning customers, products, suppliers and other business partners and any and all documents and information insofar as it relates to the collaboration proposed which is disclosed during the term of the contract and is accessible only to a limited circle of persons or where the DISCLOSER intends that it should only be available to a limited circle of persons, however that information may be disclosed, e.g. in writing, orally, by telephone, encoded, presented in graphic form, etc. and whatever the media and recording process used, e.g. optically, electronically or magnetically.\n The DISCLOSEE for the purposes of this agreement is the DISCLOSEE as defined above.\n3. The DISCLOSEE agrees to keep any and all written, electronic and oral information and models conveyed or made available to it directly or indirectly in the course of the collaboration strictly in confidence and not to disclose it or make it available to any third party without the DISCLOSER's consent in writing.\n4. The DISCLOSEE also agrees not to use the confidential information other than for the purpose as provided herein and not to use that information commercially in any way without the DISCLOSER's consent in writing.\n5. The DISCLOSEE may not make confidential information available within its enterprise or organisation other than to staff who necessarily require it to perform their duties. Such persons must demonstrably be bound beforehand to keep the information confidential to the same strict extent as agreed herein, including after their contractual relationships are terminated insofar as the law allows. The DISCLOSEE will be liable for any and all losses the DISCLOSER suffers.\n6. No licence, user or similar rights to any patent, patent application or knowhow may be deduced from this agreement, either directly or indirectly.\n7. As with the confidential information, no results obtained from that information may be disclosed to any third parties or made available otherwise without the DISCLOSER's consent in writing. This also applies without limitations to any possible termination of the business relationship between both parties.\n8.

Documents which contain confidential information must not be reproduced or extracts made from them without the DISCLOSER's prior consent in writing. Models sent must not be analysed.\n12. These obligations will not apply, or will cease to apply, to using information where the DISCLOSEE can show that that information\n/ Passed into the public domain without breaching these obligations;\n/ Was already in the DISCLOSEE's possession before the DISCLOSER disclosed it to it.\nInformation will be deemed to be confidential information for the purposes of this non-disclosure agreement even if the confidential information comes under one or more of these exceptions only in part, provided the confidential information itself does not come under one or more of these exceptions in its entirety.\n13. This agreement is binding on and against the parties' successors, wholly or in part.\n14. This agreement enters into force when signed by all contracting parties, and applies for a term of \u2026 years.\nThe agreement is engrossed in duplicate.\n Any amendments or additions to this agreement must be in writing.\n15.

Neither this provision nor any exercise by either party of its rights to equitable relief or specific performance herein granted shall constitute a waiver by either party of any other rights which it may have to, damages or otherwise. If either party brings suit to enforce the terms hereof, the successful party in such suit shall be entitled to receive all of its reasonable costs of litigation, including attorneys' fees.\n10. If any provision of this Agreement is declared void, or otherwise unenforceable, to any extent, the parties shall endeavor in good faith to agree to such amendments that shall preserve, as far as possible, the intentions expressed in this Agreement.

      "text": "NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nTHIS NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT (\"Agreement\"), is made and entered into effective as of this _____ day of ___________ 20__, by and between Commercial Investigations LLC, a New York Limited Liability Company located at 130 Remsen Street, Cohoes, NY 12047 (\u201cCI\u201d), and _____________________________________________________________________, located at __________________________________________________________________________ (collectively referred to herein as the \u201cParties\u201d and individually as a \u201cParty\u201d) who have determined that the Parties\nneed to establish terms governing the use and protection of certain confidential information that one Party (\u201cDisclosing Party\u201d) may disclose to the other Party (\u201cReceiving Party\u201d).\nRECITAL\nDisclosing Party desires to provide Receiving Party with certain of its proprietary and confidential information for the limited purpose of evaluating the possibility of engaging in a mutually beneficial transaction or relationship. In consideration thereof, and as a condition to disclosure of such information, the Parties hereby agree as follows:\n1. Subject to the limitations set forth herein, \u201cConfidential Information\u201d means any and all confidential, proprietary or trade secret information of Disclosing Party (whether oral, written, electronic or otherwise), including but not limited to marketing and sales data, customer lists, customer requirements, price lists, product and service lists, market studies, financial statements, business plans, the names and backgrounds of key personnel, research and development, service methods, processes, improvements, devices, know-how, inventions, discoveries, concepts, ideas, designs, methods and information, and all related notes, analyses, compilations, studies, specifications, designs, plans, enhancements, data of Disclosing Party and any notes or other materials prepared by Receiving Party or any of its partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, contractors, affiliates, attorneys and other advisors or representatives (collectively, \u201cRepresentatives\u201d) that contain or are generated from such information.\n2. Upon receipt of any Confidential Information, Receiving Party shall:\n(a) only disclose such Confidential Information to those of its Representatives with a need to have access to and knowledge of the Confidential Information for the limited purpose expressly stated herein and not disclose to any other person except with the prior written approval of Disclosing Party;\n(b) advise any of its Representatives who receive the Confidential Information of the existence and terms of this Agreement and of the obligations of confidentiality and non-disclosure herein; cause its Representatives to comply with this Agreement as if they were parties hereto; and be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by its Representatives;\n(c) use and require its Representatives to use at least the same degree of care to protect the Confidential Information as they use to protect their own proprietary information, which degree of care shall not be less than reasonable care; and\n(d) use, and require its Representatives to use, the Confidential Information only for the purpose expressly stated herein; provided that nothing in this Agreement is intended to limit or prevent either Party from continuing to operate its business in the ordinary course, including conducting business with any person who happens also to be a customer or vendor of the other Party.\n3. Neither Party hereto shall be obligated to preserve the confidentiality of any Confidential Information that:\n(a) prior to any disclosure by Disclosing Party was known by Receiving Party, free of any known obligation to keep it confidential;\n(b) is or becomes publicly available by other than unauthorized disclosure by Receiving Party or any of its Representatives;\n(c) can verifiably be shown to have been developed by Receiving Party or its Representatives independently of any Confidential Information of Disclosing Party; or\n(d) is disclosed by a third party, which disclosure does not violate any obligation of confidentiality.\n4. Receiving Party may disclose the Confidential Information of Disclosing Party pursuant to a valid order issued by a court or governmental agency; provided that Receiving Party only discloses that portion of the Confidential Information that is specifically required by the order, and further provided that Receiving Party provides Disclosing Party with: (a) prior written notice of such order, and (b) reasonable opportunity to oppose such disclosure or obtain a protective order or similar relief. Receiving Party agrees to cooperate with Disclosing Party in seeking any such protective order or similar relief.\n5. Neither this Agreement nor any disclosure or receipt of Confidential Information shall constitute or imply any promise, intention or commitment by either Party to enter into a business transaction with the other Party. Each Party expressly reserves the right, without giving reasons therefor, to terminate discussions with the other Party, to reject any and all proposals, and to negotiate with any person, with respect to a possible transaction or series of transactions.\n6. The disclosure of any Confidential Information by Disclosing Party under the terms of this Agreement does not constitute a representation, warranty, assurance, guarantee or inducement by Disclosing Party to Receiving Party with respect to the accuracy or completeness of the information.\n7. All Confidential Information shall remain the exclusive property of Disclosing Party unless such Confidential Information is sold by Disclosing Party to Receiving Party. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as granting or conferring to Receiving Party or any of its Representatives any rights by license or otherwise in any Confidential Information, or under any trademark, patent, patent application, design work, copyright, trade secret or any other property right now owned or hereafter owned or controlled by Disclosing Party.\n8. At any time upon written demand by Disclosing Party, Receiving Party shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, immediately return (or, at the option of Disclosing Party, destroy) all tangible or electronic Confidential Information disclosed to Receiving Party or any of its Representatives under this Agreement, along with all copies, extracts and reproductions of such information and all notes, analyses, compilations, studies, specifications, designs, plans, enhancements, data, prototypes, derivative works and all other works prepared by Receiving Party or any of its Representatives that are derived from or based on any of the Confidential Information. Receiving Party further agrees to promptly provide Disclosing Party with written certification of the satisfaction of the terms of this paragraph by Receiving Party and each of its Representatives that had possession or control of any Confidential Information. Provided, however, that Receiving Party and its Representatives may retain copies of Confidential Information, subject to the restrictions on use and disclosure contained in this Agreement, in accordance with their respective internal record retention policies for legal, compliance or regulatory purposes or to establish the rights of Receiving Party and its Representatives under this Agreement.\n9. Receiving Party agrees that it shall not, and shall cause it Representative not to, remove, overprint or deface any notice of confidentiality, copyright, trademark, logo, legend or other notices of ownership or confidentiality from any original or copies of the Confidential Information it obtains from Disclosing Party, or authorize any third party to do any of the foregoing.\n10. Each Party hereto agrees, and shall cause its Representatives, not to announce or disclose to any third person its participation in discussions with the other party concerning the matters contained in this Agreement without the advance written consent of the other Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Receiving Party may issue a statement that contains Confidential Information if, in the opinion of its legal counsel, it is required to do so by applicable laws and if it advises Disclosing Party, at least forty-eight hours in advance, of such pending disclosure and consults with Disclosing Party as to the contents of the statement.\n11. Receiving Party acknowledges that any disclosure or misappropriation of any of the Confidential Information in violation of this Agreement may cause Disclosing Party irreparable harm, the amount of which may be difficult to ascertain and, therefore, agrees that Disclosing Party shall be entitled to injunctive relief in addition to other remedies and relief that would be available at law or in equity without the necessity of proving actual damages or posting a bond. In the event of any action for breach of this Agreement by Receiving Party or its Representatives, the prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, costs and expenses incurred in such action.\n13. Each party, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, agrees that in the event a party brings any action, suit or proceedings under, or seeks enforcement of any provision pursuant to this Agreement, including without limitation any action for a temporary or permanent injunction (a) to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts of the party against whom the action or enforcement is sought , (b) to irrevocably waive any objection to the laying of the venue of any such proceeding brought in such a court and any claim that any such proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient or inappropriate forum, and (c) to irrevocably waive any right to a trial by jury in any such proceeding.\n14. All obligations of Receiving Party with respect to any Confidential Information received from Disclosing Party under the terms of this Agreement shall survive and continue for five (5) years after the date of the last disclosure of Confidential Information by Disclosing Party.\n15. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the domestic, substantive laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflicts of laws principles. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with respect to its subject matter. This Agreement may be waived, amended or modified only by an instrument in writing signed by the party against which such waiver, amendment or modification is sought to be enforced. The term \u201cperson\u201d as used in this Agreement shall be broadly interpreted to include, without limitation, any individual, group or entity. No failure or delay in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder. This Agreement is not assignable and is binding on any successors of Receiving Party. If any provision of this Agreement is for any reason adjudged to be void, invalid or unenforceable, then the remainder of this Agreement shall continue and remain in full force and effect. This Agreement may be executed in counterpart by facsimile, PDF or electronic signature, which shall be deemed to be an original for evidentiary purposes.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have executed this Agreement as of the date first written above.\n__________________________________________ Commercial Investigations LLC\nSignature:________________________ ___________ Signature:______________________________\nName:______________________________________ Name:_________________________________\nTitle:_______________________________________ Title:__________________________________\n",

The exposure of the Receiving Party to the Confidential Information or its disclosure shall not be construed in any way to grant to the Receiving Party any right or license with respect to the Information other than the right to use such Confidential Information strictly in accordance with this Agreement. Moreover, each Receiving Party shall have the right to disclose that it is evaluating the Transaction and transmit Confidential Information to its Representatives only if and to the extent that such Representatives need to know the Confidential Information for the purpose of evaluating the Transaction and are informed by such Receiving Party of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information and agree (in writing) to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.

In any event, the Receiving Party or such Person to whom it transmits Confidential Information pursuant to this Agreement will disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information which, in the reasonable opinion of its legal counsel, it is legally required to disclose and will exercise all reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to the Confidential Information.\n(d) Each Party agrees to submit to the other Party all advertising, sales, and promotional materials, press releases and other publicity materials relating to the Transaction wherein the name and/or mark of the other Party is mentioned or containing language from which the connection of said names or marks may be inferred or implied.

Such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Without the consent of the other Party, neither Party nor any of its Affiliates or Representatives will disclose to any other Person any information regarding its participation in discussions regarding, and evaluation of, the Transaction, including that Information has been made available or the status of the discussions and evaluations, except as required by law and then only with prior written notice as soon as practicable to the other Party.\n3.

Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach of this Agreement, but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity.\n5. No Grant of Rights. No license, intellectual property right or other ownership or use right is conveyed solely by this Agreement, except the limited right to use Confidential Information described in Sections 1 and 2 of this Agreement.\n6. Contact with Employees, Customers, Suppliers, etc. Except in the ordinary course of business, neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates or Representatives will initiate or maintain contact with any Person employed by Chief Enterprises or its Affiliates or with any customer or supplier of Chief Enterprises or its Affiliates, regarding the business, prospects, operations or finances of Chief Enterprises or its Affiliates except with the prior written consent of Chief Enterprises.\n7.

Non-Waiver. No failure or delay by either Party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder.\n9. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois applicable to agreements made and to be performed within such State and all disputes shall be venued exclusively in state or federal courts situated in Chicago, Illinois.\n10.

Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, no one of which needs to be executed by both Parties, and this Agreement shall be binding upon the Parties with the same force and effect as if each Party had signed the same document, and each such signed counterpart shall constitute an original of this Agreement.\n12. Severability. In the event any provision of this Agreement is invalid as applied to any fact or circumstance, it shall be modified by the minimum extent necessary to render it valid, and its invalidity shall not affect the validity of any other provision or the same provision as applied to any other fact or circumstance.\n13.

This information may include, but is not limited to, patient health records, as well as information regarding human resources, payroll, fiscal matters, research, and strategic planning, and may exist in any form, including electronic, video, spoken, or written. This Agreement applies to all members of the workforce, including but not limited to, employees, volunteers, students, faculty, physicians, and third parties, whether temporary or permanent, paid or not paid, visiting, or designated as affiliates or associates, who are employed by, contracted with, or under the direct control of FAU. This Agreement also applies to all users who are granted access to FAU-issued computing and technology resources (e.g., desktops, laptops, tablets, mobile phones, printers, etc.), application systems or access to the FAU network, whether the user is affiliated with FAU or not, and whether access to or use of the information systems occurs locally or from remote locations. I hereby agree as follows:\n\uf0b7 I will maintain patient privacy and protect and safeguard the confidentiality and security of PHI and FAU Confidential Information in accordance with Florida and federal laws and FAU policies and procedures.\n\uf0b7 I understand that access to health information created, received, or maintained by FAU or its affiliates is limited to those who have a valid business, medical, or professional need to know the information. I understand that FAU has implemented administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of PHI, and I agree not to bypass or disable these safeguards.\n\uf0b7 I will not disclose any PHI to any individual or third party, except as specifically authorized by FAU policies and procedures, and upon receiving a written authorization from the patient (unless otherwise required by applicable law), and then only on a need-to-know basis.\n\uf0b7 I will not use any PHI in an inappropriate, unethical, detrimental or unauthorized manner.\n\uf0b7 I will not discuss any information regarding FAU or patients in an area where unauthorized individuals may overhear such information, including waiting rooms, hallways, elevators and other public areas. I understand that it is strictly prohibited to discuss any FAU Confidential Information or PHI in public areas even if a patient\u2019s name is not used.\n\uf0b7 I understand that I will be given a unique User ID and password to access electronic health, operational, proprietary, student or employee or other confidential information. I understand that my User ID and password are confidential, may only be used by me, that I am responsible for safekeeping my password, that I am also responsible for any activity initiated by my User ID and password, and that in certain circumstances my User ID and password may be equivalent to my legal signature. If I suspect that my User ID or password has been compromised, I should immediately contact FAU\u2019s Office of Information Technology (\u201cFAU OIT\u201d).\n\uf0b7 I have no expectation of privacy when using FAU information systems. FAU shall have the right to record, audit, log, and/or monitor access to or use of its information systems that is attributed to my User ID. I agree to practice good workstation security measures on any computing device that uses or accesses a FAU information system. Good security measures include, but are not limited to, maintaining physical security of electronic devices, never leaving a device unattended while in use, and adequately shielding the screen from unauthorized viewing by others.\n\uf0b7 I understand that only encrypted and password protected devices may be used to transport PHI or other Restricted Data (defined below).\n\uf0b7 I understand that smartphones and other mobile devices used to access FAU information systems must be configured to encrypt any Restricted or Sensitive Data (defined below), including photographs and videos, in persistent storage. I understand that I may access and/or use FAU Confidential Information, Restricted Data and Sensitive Data only as necessary to perform my job-related duties and that I may disclose (i.e., share) FAU Confidential Information, Restricted Data, and/or Sensitive Data only to authorized individuals with a need to know that information in connection with the performance of their job functions or professional duties.\n1. Restricted Data: Data in any format collected, developed, maintained, or managed by or on behalf of FAU, or within the scope of FAU\u2019s activities, that are subject to specific protections under federal or state law or regulations or under applicable contracts (e.g., medical records, Social Security numbers, credit card numbers, Florida driver licenses, and export controlled data).\n2. Sensitive Data: Data whose loss or unauthorized disclosure would impair the functions of FAU, cause significant financial or reputational loss, or lead to likely legal liability (e.g., financial information, salary information, policies, research work in progress, and copyrighted or trademarked material).\n\uf0b7 I understand that upon termination of my employment/affiliation/association with FAU, I will immediately return or destroy, as appropriate, any FAU Confidential Information, Restricted Data and Sensitive Data in my possession. I understand that my confidentiality obligations under this Agreement will continue after the termination of this Agreement and after termination of my employment, affiliation or association with FAU.\n\uf0b7 I agree to immediately report any known or suspected violation of the confidentiality or security of PHI of patients of FAU to FAU\u2019s Chief Compliance Officer.\n\uf0b7 I understand that violations of this Agreement may result in revocation of my user privileges and/or disciplinary action, up to and including termination of my employment, affiliation or association with FAU, and that FAU may seek any civil or criminal recourse and/or equitable relief.\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\u2610 By signing or by entering my name and other identifying information on this Agreement, I acknowledge\nthat I have read this Agreement and agree to comply with all of the terms and conditions stated above.\nPrint Name Entity or Department\nSignature Date FAU ID#\nEmail\n",

The undersigned and its Representatives shall under no circumstances contact directly or indirectly any of the residents, partners or former partners or directors of Baldwin: (i) to ask any questions regarding the possible acquisition of all or part of the Assets,\n(ii) to request additional information or regarding the contents of any of the Information previously obtained, (iii) to request a facility tour or meeting, or (iv) for any other reason, except in the ordinary course of business;\n7. In the event that the undersigned, or any of the Representatives, or any one to whom any of them furnish some or all of the Information, receives a request or demand to disclose all or any part of such Information by a governmental body or deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process, the undersigned agrees to first notify BDO (to the extent permitted to do so by applicable law) by delivering written notice to the address noted above, so that BDO or its legal representative may seek an appropriate protective order; provided, however, if such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or BDO waives compliance with the provisions hereof, the undersigned or such Representative, as the case may be, may disclose such Information which the undersigned or such Representative, as the case may be, is legally required to be disclosed;\n8. The term \u201cInformation\u201d does not include and this NDA will not apply to any information that: (a) at the time of disclosure or thereafter is generally available to or known by the public (other than as a result of a disclosure by the undersigned or any of its Representatives in violation of any obligation under this NDA); (b) was available to the undersigned or any of its Representatives on a non-confidential basis from a source other than BDO who, insofar as was known to the undersigned or any of its Representatives, was not prohibited from transmitting the information to the undersigned or any of its Representatives by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation to Baldwin, BDO or any third party; or (c) has been independently acquired or developed by the undersigned or any of its Representatives without violation of any obligation under this NDA;\n9. The undersigned shall indemnify BDO, Baldwin and their representatives against any losses, costs, damages, expenses or liabilities suffered or incurred by any of them as a result of or in connection with any breach by the undersigned or any of its Representatives to whom the undersigned discloses Information of any term or provision of this NDA; provided, however, that the undersigned shall not be liable for any consequential, special, incidental, indirect or penal damages;\n10. The undersigned acknowledges and agrees that the execution and delivery of this NDA and the delivery of the Information does not give rise to any legal obligation of BDO or Baldwin, whether in contract, in negligence or other tort, by way of fiduciary duty or otherwise. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the undersigned acknowledges and agrees that BDO is not and will not be under any obligation, express or implied, to provide or to continue to provide Information, to entertain any offers or proposals for the purchase or transfer of the Assets, or to complete a sale or other transaction with the undersigned, unless and until Baldwin and the undersigned execute and deliver a legally binding agreement expressly providing for such obligations. Without limiting the foregoing, the undersigned acknowledges and agrees that neither Baldwin nor BDO has made, and they will not make, any representations or warranties, either express or implied, concerning the accuracy or completeness of, or otherwise relating in any way to, the Information. BDO and Baldwin shall not have any liability whatsoever to the undersigned or any Representatives for any transaction entered into, or not entered into, or any other act, omission or decision made or taken, relying upon or in any way affected by, the Information. The foregoing shall nonetheless be subject to any representations and warranties concerning the Information expressly given in writing in a legally binding agreement executed and delivered by Baldwin providing for a sale or other disposition of the Assets (a \u201cDefinitive Agreement\u201d);\n11. Upon receipt of a written request to the undersigned, the undersigned and its Representatives shall promptly return to BDO any and all Information received, printed, downloaded or otherwise copied together with personal notes including written materials and any notes of verbal conversations with representatives from Baldwin or BDO obtained in the course of any investigation and/or inspection of the business and the Assets being offered for sale;\n12. The terms of this NDA shall expire, as it relates only to the Information associated with the Assets or parts thereof purchased or otherwise acquired by the undersigned, upon the completion of a Definitive Agreement. In all other cases, the terms of this NDA shall expire one (1) year after the completion of a sale or other transfer of the Assets.\n13. The undersigned acknowledges and agrees that it has had an opportunity to obtain independent legal advice as to the terms and conditions of this NDA and has either received same or expressly waived its right to do so;\n14. This NDA shall enure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. This NDA shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Province of Ontario and the laws of Canada applicable therein;\n15. The undersigned acknowledges and agrees with the statements, disclaimers, and terms and conditions of the Legal Terms of Use and Disclaimer set-out in Appendix \u201cA\u201d;\n16. No failure or delay by BDO or Baldwin in exercising any rights, powers or privileges under this NDA shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any rights, powers or privileges under this NDA;\n17. No amendment to the terms and conditions of this NDA shall be valid and binding unless made in writing and signed by an authorized representative of each of the parties hereto;\n18. This NDA may be executed and delivered in any number of counterparts, each of which when executed and delivered is an original but all of which taken together constitute one and the same instrument; and\n19.

The following are the legal terms of use and disclaimer for the electronic data room, www.bdo.firmex.com (the \u201cWebsite\u201d), and any physical data provided (collectively the \u201cData Rooms\u201d) created for the sale process for Baldwin Paper Co. Limited/Papiers Baldwin Compagine Limitee and 9169-2707 Quebec Inc. o/a Papiers Baldwin (\u201cBaldwin\u201d).\n2. On February 14, 2012, BDO Canada Limited (\u201cBDO\u201d) was appointed Proposal Trustee in accordance with the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.\n3. Towards that end, BDO has in its possession certain proprietary, non-public or confidential information, documents, statements, and data relating to the assets of Baldwin (the \u201cAssets\u201d and \u201cInformation\u201d) for the review and further investigation, where appropriate, of any person or corporation interested in acquiring the Assets.\n4. The Information being made available to you, including the Information that can be found at the Data Rooms has been prepared and assembled from information provided by Baldwin and other sources. Access to the Data Rooms is being provided to you, as you have expressed a preliminary interest in acquiring the Assets and have executed a Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement (\u201cNDA\u201d) in connection thereto.\n5. The sole purpose of the Data Rooms and the Information contained therein and/or made available to you during the course of this sale process is being provided in order to assist you in deciding whether to proceed further with your investigation of the Assets. This Information being made available to you does not purport to be all-inclusive or to necessarily contain all of the information that a prospective purchaser may require in connection with its investigations into the Assets.\n6. BDO, its officers, directors, employees and agents make no representations or warranties and each expressly disclaims any and all liability for any errors and/or omissions which may be contained in the Information being made available at the Data Rooms or other information obtained in the course of any investigation and/or inspection of the Assets.\n7. Except as otherwise indicated, no independent accountant has audited, reviewed, compiled or is in any way associated with the Information presented herein nor has an independent accountant expressed any conclusion thereon or given any other form of assurance with respect thereto.\n8. In accordance with the terms of the NDA executed by you, the Information being made available to you at the Data Rooms or any other information to be made available to you by BDO is to be kept confidential and upon the express understanding that it will be used only for the purposes set forth above.\n9. The Information being made available is confidential and may not be photocopied, reproduced or distributed to any other person at any time, except for the purposes of obtaining professional advice, without the prior written consent of BDO. Upon receipt of a written request, you agree to promptly return to BDO all materials including those printed from the Website, written material and any notes of your verbal conversations with representatives of BDO obtained in the course of any investigation and/or inspection of the Assets.\n10. In providing access to the Data Rooms, BDO does not accept any obligation to provide you with access to any additional information about the Assets. The Information being made available to you at the Data Rooms or any other information to be made available to you by BDO shall not be deemed to be an indication of the current or future state of affairs of Baldwin nor shall it constitute a representation that there has been no change in the business or affairs of Baldwin since the date thereof.\n11. BDO reserves the right to negotiate with one or more prospective buyers at any time and to enter into a Definitive Agreement for the sale or other disposition of all or part of the Assets without prior notice to you or any other interested party. Also, BDO reserves the right not to sell or otherwise dispose of the Assets and to terminate, at any time, further participation in the investigation and due diligence process by you or any other party and to modify any data, documentation and other procedures relating to the proposed sale without assigning any reason thereto.\n12. Under no circumstances shall any of the residents, partners or former partners or directors of Baldwin be contacted: (i) to answer any questions regarding the possible acquisition of the Assets, (ii) to request additional information or regarding the contents of any of the Information previously obtained, (iii) to request a facility tour or meeting, or (iv) for any reason, except in the ordinary course of business.\n13. Any transaction will be subject to an approval and vesting order of the Superior Court of Justice (Commercial List).\n",

The Receiving Party and the Disclosing Party are sometimes referred to below individually as a \u201cParty\u201d and collectively as the \u201cParties\u201d. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Agreement shall have the same meaning ascribed to such terms in the Recitals below.\nRECITALS\nWHEREAS, on March 14, 2019, Laser Spine Institute, LLC, a Florida limited liability company, and the affiliated companies listed on Exhibit A attached to this Agreement (collectively, the \u201cAssignors\u201d) assigned and conveyed all of their assets (the \u201cAssigned Assets\u201d) to the Assignee;\nWHEREAS, on March 14, 2019, the Assignee filed a Petition Commencing Assignment for Benefit of Creditors in the Circuit Court of the Thirteenth Judicial Circuit in and for Hillsborough County, Florida Civil Division, styled In re: Laser Spine Institute, LLC, Assignor, to Soneet Kapila, Assignee, Case No. 2019-CA-2762, Division L;\nWHEREAS, the Receiving Party has requested that the Disclosing Party provide to the Receiving Party certain Confidential Information and Confidential Materials (as such terms are defined below) for the Receiving Party to review in order to evaluate a potential business opportunity between the Receiving Party and the Disclosing Party, including to prepare a proposal with respect to a potential sale involving the Assigned Assets (the \u201cPossible Transaction\u201d);\nWHEREAS, as a condition to furnishing the Confidential Information and the Confidential Materials to the Receiving Party and in order to protect the Confidential Information and the Confidential Materials, the Disclosing Party has required the Receiving Party to enter into this Agreement and abide by its terms; and\nWHEREAS, the Receiving Party, as a condition to receiving the Confidential Information and the Confidential Materials, has agreed to enter into this Agreement and agrees to keep such Confidential Information and Confidential Materials confidential in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and in consideration for the furnishing by the Disclosing Party of the Confidential Information and the Confidential Materials to the Receiving Party, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties, with the intent to be legally bound, agree as follows:\n1. Defined Terms.\n(a) \u201cConfidential Information\u201d shall include all information pertaining to the Assignors and their respective affiliates, employees, salespersons, independent contractors, agents, officers, directors, customers, suppliers, vendors, manufacturers, distributors, dealers, predecessors, successors and assigns disclosed by the Disclosing Party (or by a third party at the direction of the Disclosing Party) to the Receiving Party, regardless of the form or manner of disclosure (including, but not limited to, information learned by the Receiving Party from the Disclosing Party\u2019s employees, agents, officers, directors, professional advisors or other representatives or through inspection of the Assigned Assets or the books and records of the Assignors), and including, but not limited to: (i) information that relates to the Assignors\u2019 trade secrets, products, services, product specifications, data, inventions, ideas, techniques, know-how, past, current and planned research and development, current and planned methods and processes, client lists, current and anticipated client, service provider and consultant requirements, price lists, market studies, business strategy and plans, business opportunities, computer hardware, software and programs (including object codes and source codes), computer database technologies and systems, and distribution, marketing, financial, merchandising, customer, sales and/or salary information; (ii) all information concerning the Assignors\u2019 business and affairs, operations, finances, assets, liabilities, forecasts, historical financial statements, financial projections and budgets, historical and projected sales, capital spending, budgets, strategic plans, marketing and advertising plans, publications, agreements, the names and backgrounds of clients and consultants and other service providers, key personnel, personnel training, and techniques and materials; (iii) third party confidential information in the custody or care of the Disclosing Party to the extent the same is subject to a duty of confidentiality to such third party; (iv) all offering documents and materials (including offering memoranda, supplements thereto and similar documents); (v) all notes, analyses, compilations, statistics, studies, summaries, interpretations, and other material prepared by or for the Receiving Party which contain, are based on, or otherwise reflect, in whole or in part, any of the foregoing; and (vi) the existence and terms and conditions of this Agreement and the existence and content of the discussions between the Disclosing Party and the Receiving Party regarding a Possible Transaction. Information disclosed by the Disclosing Party to the Receiving Party need not be identified as \u201cconfidential\u201d to be deemed \u201cConfidential Information\u201d pursuant to this Agreement.\n(b) \u201cConfidential Materials\u201d shall mean all materials containing Confidential Information, including, without limitation, all writings and recordings, including the originals and all non-identical copies, whether different from the original by reason of any notation made on such copies or otherwise (including, without limitation, e-mails and attachments, correspondence, memoranda, notes, diaries, minutes, statistics, statements, tags, labels, invoices, brochures, periodicals, telegrams, receipts, returns, summaries, pamphlets, books, inter-office and intra-office communications, offers, notations of any sort of conversations, working papers, applications, permits, file wrappers, indices, telephone calls, meetings or printouts, teletypes, telefaxes, invoices, work sheets, and all drafts, alterations, modifications, changes and amendments of any of the foregoing), and graphic or aural representations of any kind (including, without limitation, photographs, charts, microfiche, microfilm, video tape, recordings, motion pictures, plans, drawings, and surveys), and all materials within the full scope of FED.R.CIV.P. 34 including, but not limited to, all electronic, mechanical, magnetic, or optical records or representations of any kind (including, without limitation, computer files and programs, tapes, cassettes, discs, recordings), metadata, and information stored on a computer, laptop, hand-held computer device, disk, CD, DVD, and any mechanical recording or production of any oral material.\n2. Trade Secrets. All trade secrets of the Assignors also shall be entitled to all of the protections and benefits of the Florida Uniform Trade Secrets Act (the \u201cTrade Secrets Act\u201d) and any other applicable laws. If any information that the Disclosing Party deems to be a trade secret of the Assignors is found by a court of competent jurisdiction not to be a trade secret, then such information nevertheless shall be considered Confidential Information for purposes of this Agreement. In the case of trade secrets, the Receiving Party waives any requirement that the Disclosing Party submit proof of the economic value of any trade secret or post a bond or other security. Additionally, the Receiving Party acknowledges that nothing in this Agreement (including Section 17 below) shall place a time limitation on the period of protection of such trade secret, it being agreed that the trade secrets of the Assignors shall enjoy perpetual protection against unauthorized disclosure or use, subject only to the provisions of the Trade Secrets Act and other applicable laws.\n3. Limitations. The term \u201cConfidential Information\u201d shall not include such portions of the Confidential Information that: (i) are already published or available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by the Receiving Party or any of its employees, officers, directors, members, managers, affiliates, agents, attorneys, accountants or other representatives or advisors (collectively, the \u201cRepresentatives\u201d); (ii) become available to the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a source (other than the Disclosing Party or one of the Disclosing Party\u2019s employees, officers, directors, members, managers, affiliates, agents, attorneys, accountants or other representatives or advisors) that is not prohibited from disclosing such Confidential Information to the Receiving Party by a legal, contractual, or fiduciary obligation to the Disclosing Party or the Assignors; (iii) can be shown by written documentation to have been independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of or reliance upon any Confidential Information or Confidential Materials of the Disclosing Party; and/or (iv) was demonstrably within the actual possession of the Receiving Party or its Representatives prior to it being furnished by or on behalf of the Disclosing Party pursuant to this Agreement.\n4. Property of the Disclosing Party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, all of the Confidential Information and the Confidential Materials are and shall remain the property of the Disclosing Party. By disclosing information to the Receiving Party, the Disclosing Party does not grant any express or implied right or interest in the patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret information, or intellectual property rights of the Assignors. The Disclosing Party reserves the right to limit the Receiving Party\u2019s access to the premises, facilities, equipment, customers, vendors, data and other materials, information and personnel of the Assignors (including, without limitation, as provided in Section 9 below).\n5. Non-Disclosure. The Receiving Party: (i) shall treat the Confidential Information and the Confidential Materials as confidential in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; (ii) shall not use or disclose to any person the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials for any purpose other than in connection with the consideration of a Possible Transaction, subject in all cases to the provisions of this Agreement; (iii) shall not copy or reproduce any of the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party; (iv) shall reveal the Confidential Information and the Confidential Materials only to its Representatives who need to know the Confidential Information and the Confidential Materials in connection with a Possible Transaction, and who (A) are informed by the Receiving Party of the confidential and proprietary nature of the Confidential Information and the Confidential Materials, and (B) before receiving the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials, agree to maintain their confidentiality in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; (v) except as provided in Section 7 below, shall not, without the Disclosing Party\u2019s prior written consent, disclose (A) to any other person, other than its Representatives, the fact that the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials have been made available to the Receiving Party, (B) that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning a Possible Transaction, or (C) any of the terms, conditions, or other facts with respect thereto; (vi) shall take all reasonable precautions necessary to safeguard the Confidential Information and the Confidential Materials from disclosure to any person or entity other than its Representatives, including taking reasonable security precautions at least as great as the precautions the Receiving Party takes to protect its own confidential information; and (vii) segregate all Confidential Information and Confidential Materials from the confidential information or confidential materials of others. At the request of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall require its Representatives to sign a copy of this Agreement. Regardless of whether the Receiving Party\u2019s Representatives sign a copy of this Agreement, the Receiving Party shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by its Representatives. The Receiving Party shall notify the Disclosing Party promptly upon discovery of any unauthorized use or disclosure of the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials, or any other breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives, and shall fully cooperate with the Disclosing Party to help the Disclosing Party regain possession of the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials and prevent the unauthorized use of the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials.\n6. Return of Confidential Information and Confidential Materials. The Receiving Party shall keep a written record of the Confidential Information and the Confidential Materials furnished to it and the location of such Confidential Information and Confidential Materials. At any time, at the Disclosing Party\u2019s request, all copies of the Confidential Information and the Confidential Materials shall be returned to the Disclosing Party within five (5) business days of such request; provided, however, that the Receiving Party shall be permitted to retain a list that contains general descriptions of the documents it has returned to the Disclosing Party to facilitate the resolution of any controversies after the Confidential Information and the Confidential Materials have been returned. To the extent that the Receiving Party utilizes any portion of the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials to prepare its own analyses, compilations, studies, data, notes, interpretations or other documents (the \u201cNotes\u201d), at any time, at the Disclosing Party\u2019s request, the Receiving Party shall destroy the Notes and promptly thereafter provide the Disclosing Party with written certification of their destruction. The Receiving Party shall also, within ten (10) days of a written request by the Disclosing Party, certify in writing that it has satisfied its obligations under this Section 6 or explain why the Receiving Party has been unable to do so. All Confidential Information and Confidential Materials shall continue to be subject to the terms of this Agreement even after their return or destruction or the termination of this Agreement.\n7. Legal Compulsion to Disclose Confidential Information or Confidential Materials. In the event that the Receiving Party is issued any subpoena or other process requesting any of the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials, the Receiving Party agrees that it will immediately furnish a copy of such subpoena or other process, via overnight delivery, to counsel to the Assignee, Edward J. Peterson, Esq. and Matthew B. Hale, Esq. of Stichter, Riedel, Blain & Postler, P.A., 110 East Madison Street, Suite 200, Tampa, Florida 33602, and to the Disclosing Party at the address set forth on Exhibit B attached to this Agreement. In the event that the Receiving Party is requested or becomes legally compelled (by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any of the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials, then the Receiving Party shall provide the Disclosing Party with prompt written notice of such request or requirement so that the Disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the terms of this Agreement. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or that the Disclosing Party waives compliance with the provisions hereof, the Receiving Party agrees to furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials which the Receiving Party determines in its reasonable discretion is required to be disclosed and the Receiving Party shall exercise reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance from the person to whom it furnishes the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials that confidential treatment will be accorded to such Confidential Information or Confidential Materials. The Receiving Party also agrees that it will, to the extent authorized by law, reasonably cooperate with the Disclosing Party in opposing the production of the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials; provided, however, in the event the Receiving Party incurs any cost or expense in providing such cooperation, the Disclosing Party shall promptly reimburse the Receiving Party for any such cost or expense upon the Receiving Party\u2019s tendering of a receipt therefor. If an opinion of independent counsel is required prior to compliance with a subpoena or court order, the Disclosing Party agrees to reimburse the Receiving Party for the associated costs.\n8. Attorney-Client Privilege. The Receiving Party agrees that the Disclosing Party is not waiving, and shall not be deemed to have waived, its attorney-client privilege with respect to any Confidential Information or Confidential Materials (including, without limitation, Confidential Information or Confidential Materials pertaining to pending or threatened litigation) which may be disclosed hereunder by the Disclosing Party and with respect to which the Disclosing Party has asserted, or is entitled to assert, its attorney-client privilege. The Receiving Party agrees that the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to require that such Confidential Information or Confidential Materials be disclosed only to certain specified Representatives and to the Receiving Party\u2019s legal counsel and that no further disclosure thereof be made.\n9. HIPAA Compliance. The Receiving Party agrees that it will not have access to any patient care information or records of the Assignors that are subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), absent the execution of a separate agreement that addresses HIPAA requirements. Until the consummation of the Possible Transaction, the Receiving Party agrees that it shall not contact or otherwise communicate with any patients (past, present, or future) of the Assignors without obtaining the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party and allowing one or more Representatives of the Disclosing Party to be present at the time of any meetings with any such patients. To the extent confidential patient or other information protected by HIPAA is inadvertently disclosed to the Receiving Party, the Receiving Party shall hold such information in strictest confidence, shall notify the Disclosing Party of its receipt of such information, and shall promptly thereafter return such information to the Disclosing Party and destroy any and all copies thereof. This Section 9 shall survive the closing of the Possible Transaction and/or the termination of this Agreement.\n10. Remedies. The Receiving Party shall indemnify and hold the Disclosing Party harmless from any damages, losses, costs, or liabilities arising out of or resulting from any unauthorized use or disclosure by the Receiving Party or its Representatives of the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials or other breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party or its Representatives, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, court costs and other litigation expenses incurred in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement. Given the nature of the Confidential Information and the Confidential Materials and the damage that would result to the Disclosing Party if information contained therein were disclosed to any third party, money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party or its Representatives. Therefore, in addition to all other remedies, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief as a remedy for any such breach or threatened breach, and the Receiving Party and its Representatives waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy.\n11. No Representations or Warranties. The Receiving Party acknowledges and agrees that neither the Disclosing Party nor any of its employees, officers, directors, members, managers, affiliates, agents, attorneys, accountants or other representatives or advisors (i) has made or will make any representation or warranty, expressed or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials or the relevance of the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials to the Receiving Party\u2019s determination whether to enter into a Possible Transaction or the terms on which the Receiving Party might be prepared to do so or (ii) shall have any liability whatsoever to the Receiving Party or its Representatives relating to or resulting from the use of or reliance upon the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials or any errors therein or omissions therefrom, other than as may be set forth in a definitive agreement (a \u201cDefinitive Agreement\u201d) between the Parties with respect to a Possible Transaction. Only those representations and warranties contained in a Definitive Agreement between the Parties with respect to a Possible Transaction shall have any legal effect. The Disclosing Party shall not be liable to the Receiving Party for amounts representing loss of profits, loss of business or indirect, consequential or punitive damages of the Receiving Party in connection with the provision or use of the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials.\n12. Transaction Process. Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that the other Party shall have the right to reject or accept any potential proposal or offer with respect to a Possible Transaction, for any reason whatsoever, in its sole discretion. Furthermore, neither the discussions between the Parties concerning a Possible Transaction nor the disclosure of the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials hereunder shall be interpreted or construed to limit or restrict the right of the Disclosing Party to furnish or disclose the Confidential Information or the Confidential Materials to others for any purpose it deems appropriate, including, but not limited to, the pursuit or consideration of a possible transaction with such other person or entity. The Parties further agree that unless and until a Definitive Agreement between the Parties with respect to a Possible Transaction has been executed and delivered, neither Party will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to such Possible Transaction (including, without limitation, any obligation to negotiate in good faith toward a binding contract) by reason of this Agreement, the transmission of any Confidential Information or Confidential Materials, any written or oral expression with respect to a Possible Transaction or for any other reason. Each Party reserves the right at any time to terminate its consideration of a Possible Transaction.\n13. Governing Law and Venue. The internal laws of the State of Florida, without regard to principles of conflicts of laws, shall govern the validity and interpretation of this Agreement, and the performance by the Parties of their respective duties and obligations hereunder. The Parties irrevocably and unconditionally consent to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Florida and of the United States of America located in the State of Florida, County of Hillsborough, for any actions, suits or proceedings arising out of or related to this Agreement. The Parties shall not commence any action, suit or proceeding relating to this Agreement except in such courts. The Parties agree that they may be served with process and receive notices at their respective addresses set forth on Exhibit B attached to this Agreement. The Parties irrevocably and unconditionally waive any objection to the laying of venue in any of the aforementioned courts and shall not plead or claim in any such court that an action, suit or proceeding brought in such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.\n14. Notice and Service of Process. All service of process, notices, consents, requests, claims, demands, instructions or other communications to be given hereunder by the Parties shall be in writing. All such service of process, notices, consents, requests, claims, demands, instructions or other communications may be given personally, by registered or certified mail (with proof of receipt, postage and expenses prepaid, return receipt requested), express package service, facsimile transmission, or electronic mail transmission. All such notices shall be deemed to be received as follows: (i) if delivered personally, when received, (ii) if mailed, three (3) days after being mailed, (iii) if sent by express package service, when signed for, (iv) if sent by facsimile transmission, when the fax has transmitted over the telephone lines, as evidenced by a fax confirmation report generated by the transmitting machine (provided that a copy of such notice is also sent via U.S. mail, postage prepaid), and (v) if sent by electronic mail transmission, two (2) days after being sent. All notices shall be sent to the Parties at their respective addresses set forth on Exhibit B attached to this Agreement. The Receiving Party acknowledges and agrees that all (a) requests for Confidential Information or Confidential Materials, (b) communications regarding the Possible Transaction, (c) requests for facility tours or meetings, and (d) discussions or questions regarding procedures, shall be submitted or directed to Soneet Kapila of the Disclosing Party, unless otherwise directed in writing by Soneet Kapila.\n15. Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the complete and exclusive statement of the terms and conditions between the Parties covering the subject matter hereof, supersedes all prior agreements and understandings concerning such subject matter, whether oral or written, and cannot be amended except by a written agreement executed by an authorized representative of each Party.\n16. Waiver of Breach. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be valid or binding unless the same is waived in writing by the Party against whom such waiver is to be enforced. No valid waiver of any provision of this Agreement at any time shall be deemed a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement at such time or will be deemed a valid waiver of such provision at any other time. No failure or delay by any Party in exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder.\n17. Term. Unless otherwise set forth in this Agreement, this Agreement shall terminate on the earlier to occur of: (i) the consummation of a Possible Transaction pursuant to a Definitive Agreement, and (ii) two (2) years from the date that the Parties terminate their discussions and consideration of a Possible Transaction; provided, however, that all Confidential Information and Confidential Materials shall continue to be subject to the terms of this Agreement after the termination of this Agreement.\n18. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application of any provision of this Agreement to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, or inconsistent with any present or future law, ruling, rule, policy or regulation of any court or governmental or regulatory authority having jurisdiction over the subject matter hereof, then the validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and such provision shall be deemed to be rescinded or modified in accordance with such law, ruling, rule, policy or regulation, and the remainder of this Agreement, and the application of such provision to persons or circumstances other than those to which it shall be held inconsistent, shall not be affected thereby.\n19. Binding Nature; Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors, permitted assigns and legal representatives. Neither this Agreement, nor any right hereunder, may be assigned by either Party without the prior written consent of the other Party.\n20. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by the Parties in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument. Each counterpart may consist of a number of copies hereof each signed by less than all, but together signed by all of the Parties. A facsimile signature shall be considered the same as an original signature for purposes of execution of this Agreement.\n21. Publicity. No publicity, release or announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be made by either Party without advance written approval thereof by the other Party.

Any and all information, including but not limited to, location, financial information, title reports, surveys, and other agreements, documents, materials and oral and/or written information with respect to the Property, whether delivered or made available concurrently with this Agreement or to be delivered in the future (collectively, the Confidential Information\") shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement\nThe Investor acknowledges and agrees that the Confidential Information is strictly confidential and is intended solely for the Investor\u2019s limited use and benefit in determining whether the Investor desires to express any further interest in the acquisition and development of the Property.\nWith respect to the Confidential Information, the Investor agrees as follows:\n1. NON-DISCLOSURE. Investor shall keep the Confidential Information permanently and strictly confidential, and not to disclose or divulge any Confidential Information to, or reproduce any Confidential Information for the benefit of any person or entity other than the Investor\u2019s employees, representatives, consultants, and agents who are actively and directly participating in the analysis of the Development, and in such cases only to the extent reasonably required for such analysis. The Investor also agrees to inform all such employees, representatives, consultants, and agents of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information, to provide them with a copy of this Agreement, to obtain their agreement to act in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and to take such other action as may be reasonably necessary to cause such employees to comply with these confidentiality provisions. Investor is strictly prohibited from publishing any news release, public announcement, denial or confirmation with respect to the Development, this Agreement or any information about the Property. The Investor agrees to be fully responsible for any breach of this Agreement caused by such employees, representatives, consultants, and agents.\n2. LIMITATION ON USE. Investor\u2019s use of the Confidential Information shall solely be for the purpose of evaluating the Property and the Development. If the Investor elects not to proceed with the Development, or if the undersigned is informed that the Property is no longer available for purchase or if the Investor is otherwise requested by the Owner to return the Confidential Information, the Investor will promptly return all Confidential Information (and all reproductions or destroy electronic copies thereof if any);\n3. INDEMNIFICATION. Investor shall indemnify and hold harmless the Owner and its affiliates (and their respective directors, officers, partners, agents and employees) from and against all claims, actions, causes of action, damages, losses and liabilities (including without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and expenses) arising out of or based upon any breach of this Agreement. The Investor further agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Owner harmless against any and all claims, damages, liabilities, costs or expenses arising in any way related to claims(s) by another broker, finder or similar agent for commissions, fees or other compensation for bringing about a sale of the Property to the Investor if such claims(s) is based from dealings with the Investor.\nThe undersigned further understands, warrants and agrees that:\n1. Nothing contained in the Confidential Information should be construed as a representation by any person as to the current condition or future performance of the Property. The Confidential Information speaks as of the date thereof and should not be deemed to imply that there has been no change in the condition of the Property since that date. Financial projections, if any, are provided for general reference purposes only, as they are based in part on assumptions about the general economy, competition, and other factors beyond the control of the Owner. Therefore, due to inherent limitations involved in predicting future events, actual cash flows, income and expense will differ from projections and/or from financial conditions in previous years, and the difference may be material.\n2. Owner has endeavored to include in the Confidential Information those materials which Owner believes to be reliable and relevant for the purpose of the Investor's evaluation of the Property and the Development, but the Investor acknowledges that neither Owner nor any of its agents, representatives, or employees makes any representation or warranty, either express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information.\n3. The Confidential Information is being delivered or made available to the Investor with the understanding that the Investor will independently investigate all matters that the undersigned deems appropriate in evaluating the Property and the proposed Development.\n4. The extent and irreparable nature of the damages that may result from a breach of this Agreement may make Owner\u2019s legal remedies for such a breach inadequate. Therefore, in the event of such breach or threatened breach of this Agreement, Owner shall be entitled to appropriate injunctive relief without proof of actual damages, in addition, and not in substitution for, any other remedy Owner may have.\n5. All written Confidential Information and any copies thereof in the Investor's possession or the possession of the Investor's employees or agents, including, without limitation, that portion of the Confidential Information that may be found in analyses, compilations, studies or other documents prepared by or for the Investor, shall be returned to Owner promptly upon its request. All unwritten Confidential Information shall be held by the Investor and kept strictly confidential by the Investor and its employees, representatives, and agents pursuant to the terms of this Agreement in perpetuity.\n6. This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of Michigan; and in the event of any suit or action or appeal therefrom to enforce this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to an award of its costs and attorney's fees.\n7. Each person executing this Agreement in a representative capacity represents and warrants that he and/or she is authorized to sign this Agreement on behalf of the entity set forth below.\n8. The Investor acknowledges that the Confidential Information would not have been furnished to the undersigned in the absence of this Agreement.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the following will not constitute Confidential Information for purposes of this Agreement: (i) information that has become generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by or through the Investor or its employees, representatives, and agents; (ii) information that was available to the Investor on a non-confidential basis prior to its disclosure to the undersigned by the Owner; and (iii) information that becomes available to the Investor from a source not subject, to the best knowledge of the Investor after due inquiry, to any prohibition against disclosing the information to the undersigned. Undersigned acknowledges that the location of the Property is Confidential Information.\nBrokers may not obtain the Confidential Information without first obtaining the signature of a qualified Prospective Investor.\nPROSPECTIVE INVESTOR Telephone: 480-367-9090\nFax: 480-367-9191\n________________________________\nCompany Name\nBy: _____________________________\nPrint Name: ______________________\nTitle: ____________________________\nAddress: _________________________\n_________________________________\nTelephone: _______________________\nFacsimile: ________________________\nE-Mail Address: ___________________\nKindly return the executed copy to:\nSteven A Fried, Ltd.\nSAF Investments\nSteven Fried\nRonald Fried\nCarissa DeLucia\nPO Box 6166\n",

Confidential Information. The confidential, proprietary and trade secret information of the disclosing party (\u201cConfidential Information\u201d) to be disclosed hereunder is (i) information in tangible form that bears a \u201cconfidential,\u201d \u201cproprietary,\u201d \u201csecret,\u201d or similar legend, and (ii) discussions relating to that information whether those discussions occur prior to, concurrent with, or following disclosure of the information. The disclosing party shall make reasonable efforts to mark its confidential information in tangible form with any of the aforementioned legends prior to disclosure. However, the disclosing party\u2019s information in tangible form that does not bear any of these legends, and discussions relating to that information, shall nevertheless be protected hereunder as Confidential Information, if the receiving party knew, or should have reasonably known under the circumstances, that the information was confidential and had been communicated to it in confidence.\n2. Obligations of Receiving Party. The receiving party will maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information of the disclosing party with at least the same degree of care that it uses to protect its own confidential and proprietary information, but no less than a reasonable degree of care under the circumstances. The receiving party will not disclose any of the disclosing party\u2019s Confidential Information to any employees or to any third parties except to the receiving party\u2019s employees, parent company, affiliates and subsidiaries who have a need to know and who agree to abide by nondisclosure terms at least as comprehensive as those set forth herein; provided that the receiving party will be liable for breach by any such entity. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term \"employees\" shall include independent contractors of each party. The receiving party will not make any copies of the Confidential Information received from the disclosing party except as necessary for its employees, parent company, affiliates and subsidiaries with a need to know. Any copies, which are made, will be identified as belonging to the disclosing party and marked \"confidential\", \"proprietary\" or with a similar legend.\n3. Termination of Obligation of Confidentiality. The confidentiality obligations set forth in this Agreement shall bind the Parties for a period of five (5) years from the date of disclosure of Confidential Information, unless any of the exceptions set forth in Section 4 below occurs.\n4.

Title. Title or the right to possess Confidential Information as between the parties will remain in the disclosing party.\n6. No Obligation of Disclosure; Termination. Neither party has any obligation to disclose Confidential Information to the other. Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time without cause upon written notice to the other party; provided that each party\u2019s obligations with respect to Confidential Information disclosed during the term of this Agreement will survive any such termination. Either party may, at any time: (a) cease giving Confidential Information to the other party without any liability, and/or (b) request in writing the return or destruction of all or part of its Confidential Information previously disclosed, and all copies thereof, and the receiving party will promptly comply with such request, and certify in writing its compliance.\n7. General.\n(a) This Agreement is neither intended to nor will it be construed as creating a joint venture, partnership or other form of business association between the parties, nor an obligation to buy or sell products using or incorporating the Confidential Information.\n(b) Both parties understand and acknowledge that no license under any copyrights, trademarks, or maskworks is granted to or conferred upon either party in this Agreement or by the disclosure of any Confidential Information by one party to the other party as contemplated hereunder, either expressly, by implication, inducement, estoppel or otherwise, and that any license under such intellectual property rights must be express and in writing.\n(c) The failure of either party to enforce any right resulting from breach of any provision of this Agreement by the other party will not be deemed a waiver of any right relating to a subsequent breach of such provision or of any other right hereunder.\n(d) This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of Utah without reference to conflict of laws principles, if any.\n(e) This Agreement constitutes the sole and entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Confidential Information and all restrictions thereon; it supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous oral or written agreements, negotiations, communications, understandings and terms, whether express or implied regarding the Confidential Information, and may not be amended except in a writing signed by a duly authorized representative of the respective parties.

EACH PARTY ENVISAGES PROVIDING CERTAIN INFORMATION TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR THE FOLLOWING DISCLOSURE PURPOSE(S): A POTENTIAL BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP;\nB. EACH PARTY HAS AGREED THAT DISCLOSURES OF INFORMATION BETWEEN THE PARTIES SHALL BE SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n1. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND EXCLUDED INFORMATION\n1.1. \u201cConfidential Information\u201d shall mean information that is revealed by or obtained through a party (whether in writing, orally or by any other means) (a \u201cDisclosing Party\u201d) to the other (a \u201cReceiving Party\u201d) including, without limitation, (i) all forms and types of financial, business, scientific, technical, economic, or engineering information including, for example, pricing, strategies, studies, assessments, plans, compilations, program devices, formulae, designs, methods, techniques, processes, procedures, programs, or codes and any information directly relating to the integrity or security of computer networks or systems; (ii) information traditionally recognized as trade secrets; (iii) all data and information about a party\u2019s customers (current, former or prospective) and Employees and Advisors (as such terms are defined below); (iv) the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, the Disclosure Purpose); and (v) all copies of any of the foregoing or any analyses, studies or reports that contain, are based on, or reflect any of the foregoing.\n1.2. The confidentiality obligations set forth under this Agreement do not extend to Excluded Information. For the purposes of this Agreement, \u201cExcluded Information\u201d means information that the Receiving Party can demonstrate (i) was known to the Receiving Party without restriction prior to disclosure by the Disclosing Party; (ii) became publicly available through no act or omission of the Receiving Party; (iii) is received from a third party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party; or (iv) was developed at any time by the Receiving Party independent of the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information.\n2. RESTRICTED USE\n2.1. The Receiving Party must keep Confidential Information under its control, establish and maintain adequate security measures to safeguard Confidential Information and shall treat the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information with at least the same degree of care as it protects its own confidential and proprietary information of a similar nature but, in any event, with no less than a reasonable degree of care. The Receiving Party shall only use the Confidential Information for the Disclosure Purpose.\n2.2. The Receiving Party shall not disclose, duplicate, transmit or otherwise disseminate in any manner the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information, except to the Receiving Party\u2019s officers, directors and employees (collectively \u201cEmployees\u201d), and the Receiving Party\u2019s agents, contractors and advisors (including, without limitation, financial advisors, legal advisors, auditors and accountants) retained by the Receiving Party (collectively \u201cAdvisors\u201d). All such persons receiving Confidential Information shall have a need to know and shall be bound by professional duty or in writing (in advance) to confidentiality and non-use obligations at least as protective of such information as this Agreement. The Receiving Party shall be liable to the Disclosing Party in the event that any of its Employees or Advisors breach such obligations, and upon the Disclosing Party\u2019s request, the Receiving Party shall promptly provide documentary proof of its compliance with the immediately preceding sentence.\n2.3. Each party may only make as many copies of Confidential Information as are reasonably necessary for its permitted use under the terms hereof, and each such copy will be marked with the same proprietary notices, indicia and legends that appear on the originals.\n2.4. In the event that the Receiving Party is required to disclose Confidential Information to comply with an order of a court of competent jurisdiction or with a mandatory requirement of a governing regulatory body, such party shall, to the extent permitted by law and as soon as reasonably practicable under the circumstances, inform the Disclosing Party to allow it an adequate opportunity to object to the disclosure order or to take such other actions as are necessary to preserve the confidentiality of the information. The Receiving Party shall cooperate with the Disclosing Party in such party\u2019s reasonable efforts to limit the disclosure by means of a protective order or a request for confidential treatment.\n3. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, CURRENT OR FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS\n3.1. As between the Disclosing Party and the Receiving Party, Confidential Information and all applicable intellectual property rights embodied in the Confidential Information shall remain the sole property of the Disclosing Party. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any rights to the Receiving Party or any of its Employees or Advisors, by license or otherwise, to any of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information, except to the extent as expressly stated in this Agreement.\n3.2. The Disclosing Party understands that Receiving Party may currently or in the future be developing information internally, or receiving information from other parties that may be similar to Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information. Accordingly, nothing in this Agreement will be construed as a representation or inference that Receiving Party will not develop products, or have products developed for it that compete with the products, systems or services contemplated by Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information.\n4. WARRANTIES NOR REPRESENTATIONS\n4.1. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE DISCLOSING PARTY MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, IN RELATION TO ITS CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTY AS TO THE ACCURACY, TIMELINESS OR COMPLETENESS OF ITS CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS OF THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n5. UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR USE\n5.1. Each party agrees to advise the other party promptly in writing of any unauthorized misappropriation, disclosure or use by any person of the other party\u2019s Confidential Information which may come to its attention and to take all steps reasonably requested by the disclosing party to limit, stop or otherwise remedy such misappropriation, disclosure or use.\n5.2. The unauthorized disclosure or use of any Confidential Information may cause immediate and irreparable injury to the Disclosing Party which could not be adequately compensated by monetary damages. Each party therefore authorizes the other party to seek any temporary or permanent injunctive relief necessary to prevent such disclosure or use, or threat of disclosure or use.\n6. TERM ; TERMINATION ; EFFECTS OF TERMINATION\n6.1. This Agreement shall become effective on the Effective Date stated above. This Agreement shall continue in force for three (3) years unless earlier terminated in accordance with Section 6.2.\n6.2. Each party may terminate this Agreement at any time, for any reason or no reason, by serving at least fifteen (15) days prior written notice to the other party.\n6.3. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement the Receiving Party's right to use the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information ceases and the Receiving Party must, upon the Disclosing Party\u2019s request and at the Receiving Party\u2019s expense, promptly return to the Disclosing Party or permanently destroy all of the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information in its power, possession or control. Having acknowledged that it, particularly within a networked environment, the return and/or destruction of electronically stored information may be impossible, extremely or otherwise unduly difficult or costly, the immediately preceding sentence is not intended to, and does not obligate the Receiving Party to make extra-ordinary efforts to destroy electronically stored copies of the Confidential Information, provided that, in relation to any such copy that is not destroyed the Receiving Party\u2019s obligations of confidentiality and restricted use shall continue as per the provisions of this Agreement.\n6.4. Notwithstanding Section 6.3, the Receiving Party may retain a reasonable number of copies of the Confidential Information (and any materials embedding the same) (\u201cRetained Copies\u201d) for the sole purpose of (i) satisfying any legal or regulatory requirements regarding record and data retention that the Receiving Party is obligated to comply with; (ii) enforcing this Agreement; and/or (iii) archiving consistent with good business practices and the Receiving Party\u2019s internal policies. For the avoidance of doubt, the Receiving Party\u2019s obligations of confidentiality and restricted use as set forth in this Agreement shall continue in respect of such Retained Copies as per the provisions of this Agreement.\n6.5. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, the Receiving Party\u2019s obligations of confidentiality and restricted use hereunder shall continue in force during the term of this Agreement and shall survive for three (3) years following the expiration or termination of this Agreement or, in the case of trade secrets, until such time as the Confidential Information does not qualify as a trade secret.\n7. GENERAL PROVISIONS\n7.1. Notice. Any notice required or permitted by this Agreement shall be served in writing to Imperva or Company (as applicable) to the attention of \u201cLegal Department\u201d at the notice address indicated above and will be deemed given: (i) upon receipt if by personal delivery; (ii) upon receipt if sent by certified or registered mail (return receipt requested); or (iii) two (2) days after it is sent if by overnight delivery by a major commercial delivery service. Either party may, by like notice, specify or change an address to which notices and communications shall thereafter be sent.\n7.2. Entire Agreement. Save as expressly stated herein, this Agreement represents the entire understanding between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all previous agreements, understandings or commitments between the parties whether oral or written with respect to the subject matter hereof.\n7.3. Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid, unenforceable or otherwise illegal, such provision shall be deemed restated, in accordance with applicable law, to reflect as nearly as possible the original intentions of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.\n7.4. Relationship of the Parties. The parties hereto are independent contractors and this Agreement will not establish any relationship of partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise or agency between Imperva and Company. Neither party shall have the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other's behalf without the other's prior written consent, except as otherwise expressly provided herein. This Agreement does not express or imply any commitment on behalf of either party to disclose any particular information to the other party or to purchase or sell goods or services from or to the other party, or to conclude any similar business transaction with the other party.\n7.5. Waiver. A provision of or a right created under this Agreement may not be (i) waived except in a writing executed by the party granting the waiver; or (ii) varied except in a writing duly executed by the parties. No waiver shall be deemed a waiver of any preceding or succeeding breach or right in the same or in any other provision hereof.\n7.6. Assignment. Neither party may assign or otherwise transfer its rights and obligations (in whole or in part) under this Agreement to any person or entity without the other party\u2019s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided that, either party may, without such consent, assign and transfer this Agreement to a successor to substantially all of its business or assets. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.\n7.7. Governing Law and Jurisdiction. This Agreement is governed by the laws of Queensland (and intended in conjunction with the laws of New South Wales and Victoria; when not in conflict with the laws of Queensland) and the parties agree to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Queensland (with consideration of the jurisdiction of the courts of New South Wales).\n- END OF AGREEMENT -\n",

      "text": "NON-DISCLOSURE AND NON-COMPETE AGREEMENT\nNON-DISCLOSURE AND NON-COMPETE AGREEMENT\nThis AGREEMENT (this \"Agreement\"), is made as of October 7, 2002 (the \"Effective Date\"), by and between MERITAGE CORPORATION, a Maryland corporation (\"Meritage\"), MTH-HOMES NEVADA, INC., an Arizona corporation (the \"Company\"), ZENITH NATIONAL INSURANCE CORP., a Delaware corporation (\"Zenith\"), and PERMA-BILT, a Nevada corporation (\"Seller\" and, together with Zenith, \"Selling Parties\").\nR E C I T A L S\nSeller is engaged in homebuilding and home sales operations.\nZenith indirectly owns all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Seller.\nThe Business will be acquired by the Company pursuant to a Master Transaction Agreement, dated as of October 7, 2002 (the \"Master Agreement\"). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Master Agreement.\nSelling Parties have intimate knowledge of the business practices of the Business, which, if exploited by Selling Parties in contravention of this Agreement, would seriously, adversely, and irreparably affect the ability of the Company to continue the businesses previously conducted by Seller.\nTo induce the Company to enter into the Master Agreement, Selling Parties have agreed to execute this Agreement.\nIn consideration of the premises, the mutual promises and covenants of the parties set forth herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Selling Parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:\n1. Noncompetition.\n(a) For the period beginning on the Effective Date and ending on the * anniversary thereof (the \"Restriction Period\"), neither Selling Parties nor any subsidiary, sister entity, or parent will, directly or indirectly, either as a partner or owner or in any other capacity:\n(i) engage in the homebuilding or home sales business within 100 miles of the Las Vegas metropolitan area (a \"Competing Business\");\n(ii) recruit, hire or discuss employment for a Competing Business with any person who is, or within the six month period preceding the date of such activity was, an employee of the Company or Meritage (other than as a result of a general solicitation for employment); or\n(iii) solicit any customer or supplier of the Company for a Competing Business or otherwise attempt to induce any such customer or supplier to discontinue its relationship with the Company.\n(b) Selling Parties represent to the Company and Meritage, and Selling Parties acknowledge, that:\n(i) they are willing and able to engage in a business that is not a Competing Business;\n(ii) enforcement of the restrictions set forth in this Section 1 would not be unduly burdensome to Selling Parties;\n(iii) the period of time provided for in this Section 1 and the territorial restrictions and other provisions and restrictions set forth herein are reasonable and necessary to protect the Company and its successors and assigns in the use and employment of the goodwill of the business conducted by Perma-Bilt Homes prior to the Effective Date; and\n(iv) damages cannot compensate the Company in the event of a violation of this Section 1, and that if such violation should occur, injunctive relief shall be essential for the protection of the Company and its successors and assigns.\nAccordingly, Selling Parties hereby covenant and agree that, in the event any of the provisions of this Section 1 shall be violated or breached, the Company shall be entitled to obtain injunctive relief against the party or parties violating such covenants, without bond but upon due notice, in addition to such further or other relief as may be available at equity or law. Obtainment of such an injunction by the Company shall not be considered an election of remedies or a waiver of any right to assert any other remedies which the Company has at law or in equity. No waiver of any breach or violation hereof shall be implied from forbearance or failure by the Company to take action thereof. Zenith agrees to pay any and all reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred by the Company in enforcing this provision if it is determined that Selling Parties breached this Agreement.\n(c) Selling Parties hereby agree that upon becoming a partner, member, owner or investor of another enterprise or any third-party during the period in which the terms of this Section 1 are in effect, each shall promptly disclose to such new enterprise or third-party the terms of this Section 1, and shall cause such enterprise or third-party to maintain such information in confidence. Selling Parties further agree and authorize the Company to notify others, including customers of the Company and any such future enterprise or third-party to which either Zenith or Seller may become a partner, member, owner or investor, of the terms of this Section 1 and of their obligations hereunder.\n(d) Selling Parties hereby agree that the period of time in which this Section 1 is in effect shall be extended for a period equal to the duration of any breach of this Section 1(a) by Selling Parties.\n(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Selling Parties or their affiliates or associates, any of their directors, officers or employees, or any of their representatives from investing in stocks, bonds, or other securities of any entity that engages in a Competing Business, provided, however, that in the case of capital stock, such securities are listed on a national securities exchange or traded in the over-the-counter market or registered under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and such investment does not exceed, in the case of any class of the capital stock of any one issuer, three percent of the issued and outstanding voting power at the time of such investment. In addition, nothing contained herein shall prevent any officer or director of the Selling Parties or their affiliates or associates from serving as a director or trustee of any Competing Business.\n2. Protection of Information. Selling Parties recognize and acknowledge that the Company's trade secrets and all other confidential and proprietary information of a business, financial or other nature, including without limitation, proprietary information of the Company, as it exists from time to time (collectively, \"Confidential Information\"), are valuable and unique assets of the Company and therefore agree that, during the Restriction Period, except as otherwise required by Applicable Laws, or the rules of any exchange on which any securities of Zenith are or will be listed, they will not, and will use their best efforts to ensure that their directors, officers, employees, advisers, agents and consultants do not, disclose any Confidential Information concerning the Company and/or its subsidiaries or affiliates, to any person, firm, corporation, association or other entity, for any reason whatsoever, unless previously authorized in writing to do so by Meritage. It is understood that Confidential Information shall not include any information that is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of an unauthorized disclosure by Selling Parties or that is disclosed by Selling Parties in accordance with the terms of a prior written consent of Meritage. For the purpose of enforcing this provision, the Company may resort to any remedy available to it under the law. In the event that any Selling Party is requested pursuant to, or required by, Applicable Laws, regulation or rules of any securities exchange or by legal process to disclose any Confidential Information or any other information concerning the Company, the Selling Parties agree that they shall provide the Company with prompt notice of such request or requirement in order to enable the Company to seek an appropriate protective order or other remedy, to consult with the Selling Parties with respect to the Company taking steps to resist or narrow the scope of such request or legal process, or to waive compliance, in whole or in part, with the terms of this Section 2. In the event that no such protective order or other remedy is obtained, or that the Company waives compliance with the terms of this Section 2, Selling Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to disclose only that portion of any Confidential Information which Selling Parties are advised by counsel is legally required and shall exercise all reasonable efforts to ensure that all Confidential Information so disclosed shall be accorded confidential treatment in accordance with this Section 2.\n3. Severability. In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the Restriction Period is unenforceable, the Restriction Period shall mean *. Additionally, if any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any applicable law, then such provision will be deemed to be modified to the minimum extent necessary to render it legal, valid and enforceable, and if no such modification will render it legal, valid and enforceable, then this Agreement will be construed as if not containing the provision held to be invalid, and the rights and obligations of the parties will be construed and enforced accordingly.\n4. Waiver. The waiver by either party of a breach of any provision of this Agreement by the other shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach.\n5. Injunctive Relief. Selling Parties acknowledge and agree that Meritage and the Company would be irreparably harmed by any violation of Selling Parties' obligations under Sections 1 and 2 hereof and that, in addition to all other rights or remedies available at law or in equity, the Company will be entitled to injunctive and other equitable relief to prevent or enjoin any such violation.\n6. Assignment by Company. Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude Zenith, Seller, Meritage or the Company from consolidating or merging into or with, or transferring all or substantially all of its assets to, another corporation or entity that assumes this Agreement and all obligations and undertakings hereunder. Upon such consolidation, merger or transfer of assets and assumption, the terms \"Zenith,\" \"Seller,\" \"Meritage\" and \"Company,\" respectively, as used herein shall mean such other corporation or entity, as appropriate, and this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. For purposes of Sections 1 and 2 hereof, the term \"Company\" shall mean all joint ventures (50% or more owned by Company), subsidiaries and parent companies of Company (whether corporate, partnership or other form), including the subsidiary that operates the Business as a division of Meritage Corporation.\n7. Entire Agreement. This Agreement embodies the complete agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior written, or prior or contemporaneous oral, understandings or agreements between the parties that may have related in any way to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may be amended only in writing executed by Meritage and Selling Parties.\n8. Governing Law. This Agreement and all questions relating to its validity, interpretation, performance and enforcement, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws, and not the law of conflicts, of the State of Nevada.\n9. Notice. All notices, consents, and other communications hereunder will be in writing and deemed to have been duly given when (a) delivered by hand, (b) sent by telecopier (with receipt confirmed), or (c) when received by the addressee, if sent by Express Mail, Federal Express, or other express delivery service (with delivery confirmation), in each case to the appropriate addresses and telecopier numbers set forth below (or to such other addresses and telecopier numbers as a party may designate as to itself by notice to the other):\nIf to the Company: Meritage Corporation\n6613 North Scottsdale Road, Suite 200\nScottsdale, Arizona 85250\nPhone: (480) 998-8700\nFax: (480) 998-9162\nAttention: Chief Financial Officer\nWith a copy to: Snell & Wilmer L.L.P.\nOne Arizona Center\nPhoenix, Arizona 85004-0001\nPhone: (602) 382-6252\nFax: (602) 382-6070\nAttn: Steven D.

      "text": "COVENANT NOT TO COMPETE\nThis Covenant Not to Compete (this \"Agreement\") is made this 3rd day of April, 1996 by and among Lumex, Inc., a New York corporation (\"Seller\"), Lumex Medical Products, Inc. (f/k/a MUL Acquisition Corp. I), a Delaware corporation (\"Purchaser I\"), MUL Acquisition Corp. II, a Delaware Corporation (\"Purchaser II) (Purchaser I and Purchaser II are collectively referred to herein as \"Purchasers\"), and Fuqua Enterprises, Inc., a Delaware corporation (\"Parent\").\nWITNESSETH\nWHEREAS, Seller through its Lumex division (the \"Division\") and an affiliated leasing company is engaged in the business of designing, manufacturing, marketing, selling, leasing and distributing a wide variety of health care products; and\nWHEREAS, Purchasers, wholly owned subsidiaries of Parent, are to acquire substantially all of the assets and properties of the Division pursuant to an Asset Sale Agreement, dated as of March 13, 1996, among Seller, Purchasers and Parent (the \"Asset Sale Agreement\"); capitalized terms used herein and defined in the Asset Sale Agreement shall have the meanings set forth in the Asset Sale Agreement when used herein unless otherwise defined herein or unless the context otherwise requires; and\nWHEREAS, following the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Asset Sale Agreement, Purchasers will control and conduct the Business (as hereinafter defined); and\nWHEREAS, to induce Purchasers and Parent to consummate the Asset Sale Agreement and to acquire the Assets, Seller has agreed to execute this Agreement, the terms and conditions of which are a material and integral part of the consideration for the Asset Sale Agreement;\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, the mutual promises and covenants of the parties set forth in this Agreement and the Asset Sale Agreement, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:\nARTICLE I\nDEFINITIONS\nAs used in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings unless the context specifically requires otherwise:\n1.01 \"BUSINESS\" shall mean the design, manufacture, marketing, sale, leasing and distribution of health care products of the types and performing the functions of the products designed, manufactured, marketed, sold, leased or distributed by Seller through the Division as of the date of this Agreement.\n1.02 \"COMPETE\" OR \"COMPETING\" shall mean with respect to the Business: (i) the design, manufacture, marketing, sale, leasing or distribution of health care products of the types or performing the functions of the products designed, manufactured, marketed, sold, leased and distributed by Seller through the Division as of the date of this Agreement; (ii) hiring, soliciting or attempting to hire or solicit any employee of the Division or Purchasers as of the Closing Date either on Seller's behalf or on behalf of any other person or entity; or (iii) entering into or attempting to enter into any business substantially similar to the Business, either alone or with any individual, partnership, corporation or association; provided, however, that Competing shall not mean or include the ownership, disposition or use of Excluded Assets.\n1.03 \"DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY\" as they modify the words \"Compete\" or \"Competing\" shall mean: (i) acting as an agent, representative, consultant, or independent contractor of any entity or enterprise that is Competing with the Business; (ii) participating in any such Competing entity or enterprise as an owner, partner, limited partner, joint venturer, or stockholder (except as a stockholder owning less than a five percent interest in a corporation whose shares are actively traded on a national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter market); and (iii) communicating to any such Competing entity or enterprise the names or addresses or any other information concerning any past, present or identified prospective client, customer or supplier of the Division prior to Closing.\n1.04 \"TERRITORY\" shall mean the United States of America and Canada.\nARTICLE II\nNON-COMPETITION AND NON-DISCLOSURE\n2.01 SCOPE AND REASONABLENESS. Seller acknowledges that this Agreement (including without limitation the covenants and agreements set forth in this Article II) is being entered into as an important part of the consideration received by Purchasers and Parent in connection with the acquisition of the Assets. Seller also acknowledges that Purchasers and Parent have a reasonable present and future expectation of continuing the Business within the Territory.\n2.02 CONFIDENTIALITY AND TRADE SECRETS.\n(a) Seller acknowledges and agrees that as the owner of the Division it has created substantial confidential information used in and concerning the business and has been afforded an unique opportunity to acquire confidential information concerning the Business and that the misappropriation or disclosure of such confidential information would cause irreparable harm to Purchasers and Parent. Seller acknowledges that such confidential information includes, without limitation, financial information concerning the Business, the names and addresses of actual and potential customers of the Business, studies of prospective market areas for the Business, supply sources of the Business, products of the Business, technical data concerning the Business, ideas of the Business, processes of the Business, financial matters concerning the Business, and trade secrets of the Business, such information collectively being referred to as the \"Confidential Information.\" For purposes of this Agreement \"trade secrets\" means any information that derives independent value from being secret. Confidential Information shall not include any information or documents that (i) are or become publicly available without breach of this Section 2.02, (ii) Seller receives from any third party who, to the best of Seller's knowledge upon reasonable inquiry, is not breaching an obligation of confidence with Purchasers or Parent (including such an obligation under an agreement assigned to Purchasers pursuant to the Asset Sale Agreement) or without an accompanying obligation of confidence, or (iii) is required to be released by law. In the event that Seller is requested in any court or governmental proceeding to disclose any Confidential Information, Seller shall give Purchasers and Parent prompt notice of such request, such that Purchasers or Parent may seek a protective order or other appropriate relief, and in any such proceeding Seller will disclose only so much of the Confidential Information as is required to be disclosed.\n(b) Seller will keep confidential and will not for a period of three (3) years after the execution of this Agreement, directly or indirectly, divulge to anyone, use or otherwise appropriate any of the Confidential Information for any reason or purpose whatsoever except to authorized representatives of Purchasers or the Parent.\n(c) With respect to any trade secrets included in the Confidential Information, Seller also agrees not to use or disclose any of such trade secrets at any time until such trade secrets become generally available to the public by independent discovery or development and publication through no fault of Seller. Seller acknowledges and agrees that these prohibitions against disclosure of Confidential Information are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any rights or remedies that Purchasers or Parent may have available pursuant to the laws of any jurisdiction or at common law to prevent disclosure of trade secrets or proprietary information, and the enforcement by Purchasers or Parent of any of their rights and remedies pursuant to this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any other rights or available remedies they may possess in law or equity absent this Agreement.\n2.03 NON-COMPETITION. Seller agrees that for a period of three (3) years following the execution of this Agreement, it will not, without Purchasers' prior written consent, Directly or Indirectly Compete with Purchasers in the Business within the Territory.\n2.04 NON-SOLICITATION AND NON-INTERFERENCE. Seller agrees that for a period of one (1) year after the execution of this Agreement, it will not in any way, directly or indirectly, for itself or on behalf of or in conjunction with any other person, partnership, firm or corporation hire any employee of the Division or Purchasers as of the Closing Date, or request or induce any employee of the Division or Purchasers as of the Closing Date to terminate his or her employment and accept employment with another entity.\n2.05 REMEDIES. Seller acknowledges that any violation of this Article II will cause irreparable harm to Purchasers and Parent and that damages are not an adequate remedy. Seller, therefore, agrees that Purchasers and Parent shall be entitled to an injunction, without the necessity of posting any bond, enjoining, prohibiting, and restraining Seller from the continuance of any such violation, in addition to any monetary recovery that might be available to Purchasers and Parent by reason of a violation of this Agreement and any other remedies at law or in equity, including without limitation specific performance.\n2.06 INDEPENDENT. The covenants set forth in the foregoing Sections of Article II are and shall be deemed and construed as separate and independent covenants. Should any part or provision of such covenants be held invalid, void, or unenforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, voidness, or unenforceability shall not render invalid, void, or unenforceable any other part or provision thereof. Specifically, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if any portion of Section 2.01, 2.02, 2.03 or 2.04 is found to be invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction because its duration, the Territory, and/or the Business or any definition or restriction are invalid or unreasonable in scope, such duration, Territory, and/or Business or any definition or restriction, as the case may be, shall be redefined by consideration of the reasonable concerns and needs of Purchasers such that the intent of Purchasers, the Company and Seller, in agreeing to Sections 2.01, 2.02, 2.03 and 2.04, will not be impaired and shall be enforceable to the fullest extent of the applicable laws.\nARTICLE III\nMISCELLANEOUS\n3.01 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. This Agreement may not be assigned by any party hereto, except that Purchasers' and Parent's rights, duties and obligations under this Agreement may be assigned and delegated to any subsidiary of Purchasers or Parent or to the acquiror of Purchasers, Parent or the Business in the event either Purchaser or Parent is merged, acquired, sells substantially all of its interest in the Business, or transfers its interest in the Business to any other entity. From and after any such assignment by Purchasers or Parent, the term \"Purchasers\" or \"Parent,\" as the case may be, shall mean such assignee, and such assignee may enforce any of the rights of Purchasers or Parent under this Agreement as if it were the original party hereto.\n3.02 INTEGRATED AGREEMENT AND CONSIDERATION. This Agreement constitutes the entire Agreement between the parties with regard to its subject matter and supersedes all prior agreements (other than the Asset Sale Agreement and the agreements entered into in connection therewith) relating to the same subject matter. Seller hereby acknowledges that the consideration specified herein and in the Asset Sale Agreement is good and valuable consideration received by Seller for the covenants and undertakings described in this Agreement, and such covenants and undertakings are ancillary to, and an integral part of the transactions contemplated by the Asset Sale Agreement.\n3.03 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which will take effect as an original and all of which shall evidence one and the same agreement.\n3.04 GOVERNING LAW. The terms of this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.\n3.05 PRONOUNS. All pronouns used herein shall be deemed to refer to the masculine, feminine, or neuter gender as the context requires.\n3.07 BINDING EFFECT. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors, and permitted assigns.\n[Signatures on Next Page]\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, each party has caused this Agreement to be executed on its behalf, all on the day and year first written above.\nSELLER:\nLUMEX, INC.\nBy: /s/ Robert McNally\n--------------------------------------------\nName: Robert McNally\n---------------------------------------\nTitle: Chief Financial Officer\n--------------------------------------\nPURCHASERS:\nLUMEX MEDICAL PRODUCTS, INC.\nBy: /s/ L.

      "text": "April 25, 1997\nRichard A. Bearse\nSenior Vice President, Planning and Development\nUnited Dominion Industries\n2300 One First Union Center\n301 South College Street\nCharlotte, NC 28202-6039\nDear Mr. Bearse:\nYou have requested information regarding lmo Industries Inc. (the \"Company\", \"us\" or \"we\") in connection with your consideration of a possible negotiated transaction with the Company (a \"Possible Transaction\"). In consideration of our furnishing you with the Evaluation Materials (as defined below) you agree as follows:\nCONFIDENTIALITY OF EVALUATION MATERIALS\nYou and your representatives (as defined herein) will treat confidentially any information (whether written or oral) that either we or our financial advisor, Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation (\"CSFB\"), or our other representatives furnish to you in connection with a Possible Transaction involving the Company, together with analyses, compilations, studies or other documents prepared by you, or by your representatives which contain or otherwise reflect such information or your review of, or interest in, the Company (collectively, the \"Evaluation Materials\"). You recognize and acknowledge the competitive value of the Evaluation Materials and the damage that could result to the Company if the Evaluation Materials were used or disclosed except as authorized by this Agreement.\nThe term \"Evaluation Materials\" includes information furnished to you orally or in writing (whatever the form or storage medium) or gathered by inspection, and regardless of whether such information is specifically identified as \"confidential\". The term \"Evaluation Materials\" does not include information which (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by you or your representatives, (ii) was or becomes available to you or your representatives on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Company or its representatives, provided that such source is not to your knowledge prohibited from disclosing such information to you by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation to the Company or its representatives, or (iii) is independently developed by you.\nUSE OF EVALUATION MATERIALS\nYou and your representatives will not use any of the Evaluation Materials for any purpose other than the exclusive purpose of evaluating a Possible Transaction. You and your representatives will keep the Evaluation Materials completely confidential and will not disclose the Evaluation Materials, in any manner, in whole or in part; provided, however, that (i) any of such information may only be disclosed to those of your directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives (including attorneys, accountants and financial advisors), lenders and other sources of financing (collectively, \"your representatives\") who need to know such information for the purpose of evaluating a Possible Transaction between you and the Company (it being understood that your representatives shall be informed by you of the confidential nature of such information and shall be directed by you and shall agree to treat such information confidentially in accordance with this Agreement) and (ii) any other disclosure of such information may only be made if the Company consents in writing prior to any such disclosure. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that a Possible Transaction is not consummated neither you nor your representatives shall use any of the Evaluation Materials for any purpose. You will be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by your representatives.\nIn the event that you or any of your representatives receive a request or are required (by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose all or any part of the Evaluation Materials, you or your representatives, as the case may be, agree to (i) immediately notify the Company of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding such a request, (ii) consult with the Company on the advisability of taking legally available steps to resist or narrow such request and (iii) assist the Company (at the Company's expense) in seeking a protective order or other appropriate remedy. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained or that the Company waives compliance with the provisions hereof, (i) you or your representatives, as the case may be, may disclose to any tribunal only that portion of the Evaluation Materials which you are advised by counsel is legally required to be disclosed, and shall exercise your best efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such Evaluation Materials and (ii) you shall not be liable for such disclosure unless disclosure to any such tribunal was caused by or resulted from a previous disclosure by you or your representatives not permitted by this Agreement.\nNON-DISCLOSURE\nThe disclosure of your possible interest in negotiating a transaction with the Company could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business if for any reason an agreement is not consummated. Accordingly, unless required by applicable law, you agree that prior to the closing of a Possible Transaction, without the prior written consent of the Company, you will not, and you will direct your representatives not to, disclose to any person either the fact that you have entered into this Agreement, that Evaluation Materials have been made available or that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning a Possible Transaction between you and the Company or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to any such Possible Transaction, including the status thereof. The term \"person\" as used in this letter shall be broadly interpreted to include, without limitation, any corporation, the Company, governmental agency or body, stock exchange, partnership, association or individual.\nRETURN OF DOCUMENTS\nUpon the Company's request, you shall promptly deliver to the Company or destroy all written Evaluation Materials and any other written materials without retaining, in whole or in part, any copies, extracts or other reproductions (whatever the form or storage medium) of such materials, and shall certify the destruction of such materials in writing to the Company. Notwithstanding the return or destruction of the Evaluation Materials, you and your representatives will continue to be bound by your obligations pursuant to this Agreement.\nNO UNAUTHORIZED CONTACT OR SOLICITATION\nDuring the course of your evaluation, you agree that all inquiries and other communications are to be made directly to CSFB or employees or representatives of the Company specified by CSFB.\nWithout the Company's prior written consent, the persons who are involved in the possible transaction will not for a period of two years from the date of this Agreement directly or indirectly solicit for employment any person who is now employed by the Company (or whose activities are dedicated to the Company) in an executive or management level position or otherwise considered by the Company to be a key employee.\nSTANDSTILL\nYou agree that until one year from the date of this Agreement, you will not without the prior approval of the Board of Directors of the Company (i) acquire or make any proposal to acquire any securities or property of the Company, (ii) propose to enter into any merger or business combination involving the Company or purchase a material portion of the assets of the Company, (iii) make or participate in any solicitation of proxies to vote, or seek to advise or influence any person with respect to the voting of any securities of the Company, (iv) form, join or participate in a \"group\" (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) with respect to any voting securities of the Company, (v) otherwise act or seek to control or influence the management, Board of Directors or policies of the Company, (vi) disclose any intention, plan or arrangement inconsistent with the foregoing or (vii) take any action which might require the Company to make a public announcement regarding the possibility of a business combination or merger. Except as provided above, you also agree during such period not to request the Company (or its directors, officers, employees, agents or representatives) to amend or waive any provision of this paragraph.\nNO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY\nAlthough the Company and CSFB have endeavored to include in the Evaluation Materials information known to them which they believe to be relevant for the purpose of your investigation, you acknowledge and agree that none of the Company, CSFB or any of the Company's other representatives or agents is making any representation or warranty, expressed or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Materials, and none of the Company, CSFB or any of the Company's other representatives or agents, nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives, stockholders, owners, affiliates, advisors or agents, will have any liability to you or any other person resulting from the use of Evaluation Materials by you or any of your representatives, except as may be set forth in a definitive sale agreement. Only those representations or warranties that are made in a definitive agreement relating to the Company (\"Sale Agreement\") when, as, and if it is executed, and subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be specified in such Sale Agreement, will have any legal effect.\nYou also acknowledge and agree that no contract or agreement providing for a Possible Transaction shall be deemed to exist between you and the Company unless and until a Sale Agreement has been executed and delivered by you and each of the other parties thereto. You also agree that unless and until a Sale Agreement between the Company and you with respect to a Possible Transaction has been executed and delivered by you and each of the other parties thereto, there shall not be any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to any such transaction by virtue of this agreement or any other written or oral expression with respect to such transaction except, in the case of this Agreement, for the matters specifically agreed to herein. For purposes of this Agreement, the term \"Sale Agreement\" does not include an executed letter of intent or any other preliminary written agreement, nor does it include any oral acceptance of an offer or bid by you.\nYou further understand and agree that (i) the Company and CSFB shall be free to conduct the process regarding a transaction involving the Company as they in their sole discretion shall determine (including, without limitation, negotiating with any other interested parties and entering into a Sale Agreement without prior notice to you or to any other person), (ii) any procedures relating to such sale may be changed at any time without notice to you or any other person and (iii) you shall not have any claims whatsoever against the Company, CSFB or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, stockholders, owners, affiliates, agents or representatives arising out of or relating to a transaction involving the Company (other than those as against the parties to a Sale Agreement with you in accordance with the terms thereof).\nLEGAL REMEDY\nYou understand and agree that the Company would be irreparably injured and that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by you or your representatives and that the Company will be entitled to seek specific performance and injunctive relief as remedies for any such breach. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach of this Agreement by you or your representatives but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity.\nThis Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto regarding the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may be changed only by a written agreement signed by the parties hereto or their authorized representatives.\nYou hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the United States of America located in the State of New York for any actions, suits or proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (and you agree not to commence any action, suit or proceeding relating thereto except in such courts), and further agree that service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to your address set forth above shall be effective service of process for any action, suit or proceeding brought against you in any such court. You hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waive any objection to the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, in the courts of the United States of America located in the State of New York, and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waive and agree not to plead or claim in any such court that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.\nIt is understood and agreed that no failure or delay by the Company in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder.\nThis Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to the conflicts of law principles thereof.\nThis Agreement and all of your obligations hereunder shall expire five years after the date hereof.\nIf you are in agreement with the foregoing, please sign and return one copy of this letter, it being understood that all counterpart copies will constitute but one agreement with respect to the subject matter of this letter.\nVery truly yours,\nIMO INDUSTRIES INC.\nBy Credit Suisse First Boston\nCorporation,\nsolely as Company's representative\nBy: /s/ JONATHAN ROUNER\n------------------------------------\nJonathan Rouner\nDirector\nAccepted and agreed to as of the date hereof:\nUNITED DOMINION INDUSTRIES\nBy: /s/ RICHARD A.

The Merger Agreement provides for a merger of the Company with and into Mergerco, with Mergerco as the surviving corporation of such merger (the \"Merger\"). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, each outstanding share of the Company's capital stock will be converted into the right to receive cash, certain promissory notes of AUGI and shares of Common Stock, $.01 par value per share of AUGI.\nIn order to induce AUGI and Mergerco to consummate the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, and intending to be bound by the terms and conditions hereof, the undersigned Stockholders of the Company who beneficially own 100% shares of the issued and outstanding shares of Company capital stock, shall receive in connection with the Merger Agreement (i) an aggregate of 507,246 shares of Class A Common Stock, $.01 par value per share, of AUGI (\"AUGI Common Stock\"), (ii) $600,000 principal amount of three year notes of AUGI (the \"AUGI Notes\"), and (iii) $780,000 in cash, hereby covenants and agrees with the Company and AUGI as follows:\n1. Non-Competition. Each of the Stockholders severally agrees that for a period (the \"Restrictive Period\") which shall commence on the Effective Date of the Merger and shall expire on a date which shall be the latest to occur of: (a) such date as such Stockholder shall no longer be employed on a full-time basis with AUGI or any other subsidiary or affiliate of AUGI; or (b) three (3) years following the effectiveness of the Merger (the \"Restrictive Period\"), without the prior written consent of AUGI, such Stockholder shall not invest, carry on, engage or become involved, either as an employee, agent, advisor, officer, director, stockholder, manager, partner, joint venturer, participant or consultant in any business enterprise (other than Mergerco, AUGI or any of their respective subsidiaries, affiliates, successors or assigns) which derives any material revenues from the offer or sale in the United States from time to time during the Restrictive Period of services relating to all aspects of providing site acquisition, zoning, architectural and engineering consulting and design services to the wireless telecommunications industry (the \"Business\"), or which engages in any other business substantially similar to and directly competitive with the Business conducted by the Company as at the date hereof. Nothing contained in this Section 1 shall be deemed to prevent a Stockholder from (a) leasing or renting real property in which the Stockholder owns a direct or indirect interest to a person or entity engaged in the Business; or (b) beneficially owning, directly or indirectly, 5% or less of any class of securities of an entity that has a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, so long as such securities ownership does not include any operational, managerial or consulting relationship with such corporation or entity.\n2. Confidential Information.\n(a) Each of Stockholders severally agrees that such Stockholder shall not, at any time following the effectiveness of the Merger, print, publish, divulge or communicate to any person, firm, corporation or other business organization or use for his or their own account any business contacts, customers, suppliers, technology, product designs and specifications, know-how, trade secrets, marketing techniques, promotional materials or other secret or confidential information relating to the Business or any other businesses then being engaged in by AUGI or any of its subsidiaries, or any secret or confidential information relating to the affairs, dealings and concerns of the Company, AUGI or any of the subsidiaries of AUGI (collectively, the \"Confidential Information\") which the Stockholder has received or obtained while an employee or member of the Board of Directors of AUGI or the Company (whether or not developed, devised, or otherwise created in whole or in part by the efforts of the Stockholder). The term \"Confidential Information\" does not include information which information and its relevance in the particular instance (A) is a matter of common knowledge or public record, (B) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by the Stockholder, (C) which information and its relevance is generally known in Business, (D) the Stockholder can demonstrate that such information and its relevance in the applicable instance, was already known to the recipient thereof other than by reason of any breach of any obligation of the Stockholder under this Agreement or any other confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement, or (E) the information is required to be disclosed by law or pursuant to court order or subpoeona.\n(b) The term Confidential Information as defined in Section 2(a) hereof shall include information obtained by the Company from any third party under an agreement including restrictions on disclosure known to the Stockholder.\n(c) In the event that a Stockholder is requested pursuant to subpoena or other legal process to disclose any of the Confidential Information, such Stockholder will provide the Company with prompt notice (unless notice is prohibited by law) so that the Company may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with Section 2 of this Agreement. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained or that the Company waives compliance with the provisions of Section 2 of this Agreement, the Stockholder will furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which is legally required.\n3. Material Agreement.\n(a) It is understood by and between the parties hereto that the foregoing covenants by the Stockholders are essential elements of this Agreement and that but for the agreements of the Stockholders to comply with such covenants, AUGI would not have entered into the Merger Agreement or paid the Merger Consideration to the Stockholders. AUGI and the Stockholders have independently consulted with their respective counsel and have been advised concerning the reasonableness and propriety of such covenants with specific regard to the businesses conducted by the Company.\n(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, express or implied, contained in this Agreement, the Merger Agreement or in any other \"Transaction Document\" (as that term is defined in the Merger Agreement), no future act of omission or commission by AUGI or any of its affiliates, or other actual or alleged breach by AUGI or such affiliates of any of their covenants or agreements contained in any Transaction Documents (in addition to this Agreement), shall in any way be deemed to modify, limit or terminate the covenants and agreements of the Stockholders contained in Section 1 and Section 2 hereof, all of which shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with their respective terms.\n4. Without intending to limit the remedies available to AUGI or the Company, each Stockholder further agrees that damages at law will be an insufficient remedy to AUGI if such Stockholder(s) breaches the terms of this Agreement and that AUGI or the Company may apply for and have injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to restrain the breach or threatened breach of or otherwise to specifically enforce any of the covenants contained herein, in each case without the necessity of proving damages or posting bond.\n5. This Agreement shall become effective upon the effectiveness of the Merger and shall terminate prior to the expiration of the Restrictive Period only with the written consent of AUGI.\n6. Any paragraph, sentence, phrase or other provision of this Agreement which is in conflict with any applicable statute, rule or other law shall be deemed, if possible, to be modified or altered to conform thereto or, if not possible, to be omitted herefrom. The invalidity of any portion hereof shall not affect the force and effect of the remaining valid portion hereof.\n7. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED (BOTH AS TO VALIDITY AND PERFORMANCE) AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE APPLICABLE TO AGREEMENTS MADE AND TO BE PERFORMED WHOLLY WITHIN SUCH JURISDICTION.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement has been duly executed by or on behalf of each party hereto on the date set forth above.\nAMERICAN UNITED GLOBAL, INC.\nBy:_____________________________________\nName:\nTitle:\nTHE STOCKHOLDERS:\n________________________________________\nSIMANTOV MOSKONA\n________________________________________\nSERGIO LUCIANI\n",

      "text": "MUTUAL NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nEffective Date: 12/10/98\nThis Agreement governs the disclosure of information by and between Yahoo! Inc., a California corporation, and Restrac, Inc. (\"Participant\").\n1. The \"Confidential Information\" is that confidential, proprietary, and trade secret information being disclosed by the disclosing party described as (please be specific):\n(a) Yahoo Confidential Information (owned by Yahoo and any of its affiliates): Resume and Employment Related.\n(b) Participant Confidential Information: Resume and Employment\nRelated.\n2. Except as set forth in this Section 2, all Confidential Information shall be in tangible form and shall be marked as Confidential or proprietary information of the disclosing party. If the Confidential Information is disclosed orally or visually, it shall be identified as such at the time of disclosure and confirmed in a writing to the recipient within thirty (30) days of such disclosure.\n3. Each of the parties agrees that it will not make use of, disseminate, or in any way disclose any Confidential Information of the other party to any person, firm or business, except to the extent necessary for negotiations, discussions and consultations with personnel or authorized representatives of the other party and any purpose the other party may hereafter authorize in writing. Each of the parties agrees that it shall disclose Confidential Information of the other party only to those of its employees who need to know such information and who have previously agreed, either as a condition to employment or in order to obtain the Confidential Information, to be bound by terms and conditions substantially similar to those of this Agreement.\n4. There shall be no liability for disclosure or use of Confidential Information which is (a) in the public domain through no fault of the receiving party (b) rightfully received from a third party without any obligation of confidentiality, (c) rightfully known to the receiving party without any limitation on use or disclosure prior to its receipt from the disclosing party, (d) independently developed by the receiving party, (e) generally made available to third parties without any restriction on disclosure, or (f) communicated in response to a valid order by a court or other governmental body, as otherwise required by law, or as necessary to establish the rights of either party under this Agreement (provided that the party so disclosing has provided the other party with a reasonable opportunity to seek protective legal treatment for such Confidential Information).\n5. \"Residual Information\" shall mean any Confidential Information of the disclosing party which may be retained in intangible form in the minds of those individuals of the receiving party who have had proper access to such Confidential Information. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, the receiving party shall be free to use any Residual Information for any purpose whatsoever, including, without limitation, the development of its own products, provided that such party shall not be entitled to disclose Residual Information to any third parties unless such disclosure is in the course of, or as part of, any disclosure of its own products or their development.\n6. Each of the parties agrees that it shall treat all Confidential Information of the other party with the same degree of care as it accords to its own Confidential Information and each of the parties represents that it exercises reasonable care to protect its own Confidential Information.\n7. Each of the parties agrees that it will not modify, reverse engineer, decompile, create other works from, or disassemble any software programs contained in the Confidential Information of the other party unless otherwise specified in writing by the disclosing party.\n8. All materials (including, without limitation, documents, drawings, models, apparatus, sketches, designs and lists) furnished to one party by the other, and which are designated in writing to be the property of such party, shall remain the property of such party and shall be returned to it promptly at its request, together with any copies thereof.\n9. This Agreement shall govern all communications between the parties that are made during the period from the effective date of this Agreement to the date on which either party receives from the other written notice that subsequent communications shall not be so governed, provided, however that each party's obligations under Sections 2 and 3 with respect to Confidential Information of the other party which it has previously received shall continue unless and until such Confidential Information falls within Sections 4 or 5.\n10. Neither party shall communicate any information to the other in violation of the proprietary rights of any third party. Neither party acquires any licenses under any intellectual property rights of the other party under this Agreement. This Agreement shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the United States of America and by the laws of the State of California as such laws are applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within California between California residents. This Agreement may only be changed by mutual agreement of authorized representatives of the parties in writing. All notices or reports permitted or required under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be by personal delivery, telegram, telex, telecopier, facsimile transmission or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, and shall be deemed given upon personal delivery, five (5) days after deposit in the mail, or upon acknowledgment of receipt of electronic transmission. Notices shall be sent to the addresses set forth at the end of this Agreement or such other address as either party may specify in writing.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement in duplicate as of the date first written above.\n<TABLE>\n<S> <C>\nYAHOO!

      "text": "Non-Disclosure Agreement\nThis Non-Disclosure Agreement (the \"Agreement\") is entered into as of the 5th day of June, 2000, by and between Kaplan, Inc. located at 888 Seventh Avenue, New York, New York 10106 (\"Kaplan\") and Quest Education Corporation located at 1400 Hembree Road, Suite 100, Roswell, Georgia 30076 (\"Company\").\nIn order to pursue a potential strategic alliance, acquisition or other business relationship, Kaplan and Company recognize that there is a need to disclose to each other certain confidential information of each party to be used solely for the purpose of evaluating this opportunity.\nEach party intends to protect such confidential information of the other party from unauthorized use and disclosure. In consideration of the disclosures, the parties hereby agree as follows:\n1. This Agreement shall apply to: (a) confidential or proprietary exchanged material and information (in written, taped or computerized form or format) that is clearly and prominently marked \"Proprietary or \"Confidential\" or that is not so marked but, by its nature, is such that it reasonably should be held in confidence, including, but not limited to, technical, developmental, marketing, editorial, sales, operating, performance, cost, know-how, computer programming techniques, and any new or planned programs and services; (b) the existence and substance of oral and written communications between the parties about the potential strategic alliance, acquisition or other business relationship; and (c) the existence of the discussions between Company and Kaplan about the potential strategic alliance, acquisition or other business relationship. (Subparagraphs (a), (b) and (c) above hereinafter referred to collectively as \"Confidential Information.\")\n2. Each party agrees to hold the other's Confidential Information in confidence and to use it solely for the purposes contemplated herein and agrees further that the Confidential Information shall not be used for any other purpose nor disclosed to any third party without the prior written consent of the other party. Each party agrees it shall apply the same level of confidential treatment to the other party's Confidential Information as it does to its own Confidential Information.\n3. The parties may disclose the Confidential Information to their respective officers, directors, employees, attorneys, subsidiaries and affiliates working in connection with the purpose for which the Confidential Information is disclosed but only to the extent necessary to carry out that purpose and subject to all requirements of confidentiality set forth in this Agreement. The party receiving the Confidential Information (the \"Receiving Party\") may also disclose Confidential Information to a third party pursuant to paragraph 4(g) below and subject to the notice provision set forth therein.\n4. The obligations under this Agreement shall not apply to information that is at any time: (a) already known to the Receiving Party at the time it is\ndisclosed to the Receiving Party; (b) publicly known through no wrongful act of the Receiving Party; (c) rightfully received from a third party without restriction on disclosure and without breach of this Agreement; (d) independently developed by the Receiving Party; (e) approved for release by written authorization of the party disclosing the Confidential Information (the \"Disclosing Party\"); (f) furnished by the Disclosing Party to a third party without written restriction on disclosure; or (g) disclosed pursuant to a requirement of a governmental agency or of law, provided, however, that, to the extent viable under the circumstances, the party subject to the disclosure requirement has notified the Disclosing Party in advance of such disclosure and the Disclosing Party has had an opportunity to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and the party subject to the disclosure requirement has reasonably cooperated with such efforts; and provided further, however, that the -------- ------- -------\nReceiving Party furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information that is legally required to be so disclosed.\n5. The Receiving Party shall not reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, or otherwise analyze, restructure and/or copy or in any way recreate in whole or in part any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party.\n6. If any party provides any of the other parties with written notification of its request for return of its Confidential Information, then the other party(ies) shall promptly return (unless destroyed pursuant to the immediately following sentence) to the notifying party all materials and information comprising the notifying party's Confidential Information, including any and all copies, facsimiles and reproductions thereof, and any other material containing or reflecting any materials or information in the Confidential Information. All other documents, memoranda, notes and other writings whatsoever prepared by the Receiving Party or the Receiving Party's representatives based on the materials or information in the Confidential Information shall be destroyed and such destruction shall be confirmed in writing to the notifying party.\n7. All right, title and interest in and to the Confidential Information and intellectual property produced based on the Confidential Information is and shall remain the sole property of the Disclosing Party. Subject only to the Receiving Party's limited use of the Confidential Information for the purpose set forth above in this Agreement, the Receiving Party acknowledges and agrees that nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any rights, license or otherwise, to any Confidential Information disclosed pursuant to this Agreement, and the Receiving Party shall not violate any of the Disclosing Party's intellectual property or other rights in or to the Confidential Information.\n8. The parties hereby acknowledge that disclosure of any Confidential Information in violation of the terms hereof would cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party. Without prejudice to the rights and remedies otherwise available, each party is entitled to equitable relief through injunction if the other party or any of its employees, agents or representatives breaches any provision of this Agreement.\n9. The parties acknowledge that each has endeavored to include in the Confidential Information information which it believes to be reliable and relevant for the purpose first set forth above, however each party understands and acknowledges that neither party nor any of their respective representatives made or makes any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information. The parties further agree that neither party nor any of their respective representatives shall have any liability to the other party or any of such other party's representatives resulting from the use or contents of the Confidential Information or from any action taken or inaction occurring in reliance on the Confidential Information.\n10. This Agreement shall remain in effect for a period of one (1) year from the effective date hereof.\n11. Each party acknowledges and agrees that nothing in this Agreement shall impose upon any party any obligation to consummate a transaction or to enter into any discussions or negotiations with respect thereto. Further, each party understands that the other party may now market or have under development products and/or services which are competitive with the products or services now offered or which may be offered in the future by its own company. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, discussions and/or communications between the parties hereto will not serve to impair the right of each party to develop, make, use, procure and/or market products or services now or in the future which may be competitive with those offered by the other party nor require either party to disclose any planning or other information to the other party, provided none of the foregoing activities violate the terms of this Agreement.\n12.

Neither party may assign or transfer, in whole or in part, any of its rights, obligations or duties under this Agreement.\n16. The failure or delay of either party to enforce at any time any provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such party's right thereafter to enforce each and every provision of this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal, void, or unenforceable, then such provision shall be modified by the proper court or other authority to the extent necessary and possible to make such provision enforceable, and such modified provision and all other provisions of this Agreement shall be given effect separately from the provision or portion thereof determined to be invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable and shall not be affected thereby.\n17.

      "text": "NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nTHIS NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT (the \"Agreement\") made this 18th day of November, 2005, by and between Yale University School of Medicine, a nonprofit, educational corporation, organized and existing under the laws of the State of Connecticut, with an office located at Yale University School of Medicine, having its principal office at 47 College Street, Suite 203, New Haven, Connecticut (hereinafter, the \"Pilot Site\") and Advanced BioPhotonics Inc., a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware , with its principal office at 125 Wilbur Place, Suite 120, Bohemia, New York (hereinafter, the \"ABP\") and the parties hereby agree as follows:\n1. The parties intend to pursue a Pilot Study to test its functionality, performance and reliability to determine the applicability of this technology to plastic surgery applications, which will be carried out by Dr. Yuan Liu utilizing ABP's BioScanIR(R) system consisting of the following elements: (i) system hardware components: infrared camera, mobile cart, computer workstation, camera power supply, universal power management unit, temperature controller and black body; (ii) proprietary DIRI(R) software for control of system components, data acquisition, data processing, data archiving and reporting; and (iii) applications software packages (hereinafter, collectively referred to as the \"System\") as further defined in the Pilot Site Agreement between the parties (hereinafter referred to as the \"Pilot Study\"), and in the course of which the parties may exchange Proprietary Information, as hereinafter defined. The parties further desire to protect such Proprietary Information from unauthorized disclosure and use under the terms and conditions herein.\n2. For purposes of this Agreement, Proprietary Information shall mean, without limitation, computer programs, code, algorithms, names and expertise of employees and consultants, formulas, processes, inventions, schematics and other technical, business, financial, pricing and product development plans, forecasts and strategies, together with any analysis or tangible embodiments of the Disclosing Party's Proprietary Information created by the Receiving Party. Proprietary Information shall be designated as such in writing by the Disclosing Party by appropriate legend or stamp, or, if first disclosed in a non-written or other non-tangible form, Proprietary Information shall be identified by the Disclosing Party at the time of disclosure as being disclosed in confidence and shall be reduced to tangible form and marked as confidential or proprietary and such tangible form shall be delivered to the Receiving Party within thirty (30) days after the date of first disclosure. During the above stated thirty-day period such Proprietary Information shall be protected in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Proprietary Information shall further include any information or data that evidence, record, derive from or reveal any Proprietary Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the components of the System are hereby deemed to be Proprietary Information and as such are protected in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.\n3. The Receiving Party shall preserve Proprietary Information received from the Disclosing Party in confidence by exercising at least the same degree of care used to restrict disclosure and use of the Receiving Party's own similar confidential information, but at least a reasonable degree of care, and shall refrain from disclosing such Propriety Information to its employees not involved in the Pilot Study, its consultants, representatives, or agents ( the \"Affiliates\") or to any third party without written authorization from the Disclosing Party. This Agreement shall be construed to bind and impose obligations upon any other divisions, subsidiaries, business units, and/or affiliated companies of the Receiving Party that receive access to the Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party. The Receiving Party shall ensure that all copies of Proprietary Information stored electronically on its server, tape backup or on the hard drives of computers used by its Affiliates in connection with the Pilot Study have been permanently deleted and Receiving Party shall certify such deletion in writing to the Disclosing Party. Receiving Party will ensure that all of its Affiliates sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement containing confidentiality restrictions at least as restrictive as those set forth in this Agreement.\n4. The Receiving Party shall use Proprietary Information received from the Disclosing Party solely for the purposes set forth in Paragraph 1. Any other use of the Proprietary Information is explicitly forbidden. This restriction shall survive termination of this Agreement.\n5. This Agreement shall not restrict disclosure or use of Proprietary Information that is:\nA. Now, or hereafter becomes, through no act or failure to act on the part of Receiving Party, generally known or available; or B. Known by the Receiving Party at the time of receiving such information as evidenced by records of the Receiving Party; or\nC. Hereafter furnished to the Receiving Party, as a matter of right and without restriction on disclosure, by a third party who had not received any Proprietary Information from the Disclosing Party or the Receiving Party; or\nD. is approved by the disclosing party for disclosure without restriction in a written document which is signed by a duly authorized officer of such disclosing party; or\nE. Independently developed by the Receiving Party by persons who did not have access to the Disclosing Party's information and without breach of this Agreement.\n6. The Receiving Party may disclose the Disclosing Party's Proprietary Information to the extent required to be disclosed pursuant to final court order; provided, however, that the Receiving Party: (i) immediately notifies the Disclosing Party upon its receipt of any court order or other document that requests or demands disclosure of Proprietary Information; and (ii) assert the privileged and confidential nature of the Proprietary Information against the third party seeking disclosure; and (iii) cooperate fully with the Disclosing Party in protecting against any such disclosure and/or obtaining a protective order narrowing the scope of such disclosure of the Proprietary Information. In the event that such protection against disclosure is not obtained, the receiving party will be entitled to disclose the Proprietary Information, but only to the extent necessary to legally comply with such compelled disclosure and to have such required disclosure made under a protective secrecy order.\n7. The Receiving Party shall notify the Disclosing Party in writing immediately upon discovery of any unauthorized use or disclosure of Proprietary Information, and will reasonably cooperate with the Disclosing Party to regain possession of the Proprietary Information and prevent its further unauthorized use.\n8. Proprietary Information shall remain the property of the originating party. Neither this Agreement nor any exchange of Proprietary Information hereunder shall be construed as granting any right or license under any copyright, invention, or patent now or hereafter owned or controlled by either party. Each party shall use and rely upon Proprietary Information received from the other at its sole risk and expense.\n9. All notices, instructions, requests, authorizations, consents, demands and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be sent by facsimile, overnight courier or registered airmail, postage prepaid, addressed as follows:\nFor Pilot Site:\nYale Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery\nDepartment of Surgery\nYale School of Medicine\n333 Cedar Street (BB-330)\nP.O.

The confidentiality obligations under this Agreement will survive termination of this Agreement for a period of three (3) years.\n11. Upon termination, the Receiving Party shall cease use of the Disclosing Party's Proprietary Information, and shall destroy all Proprietary Information, including without limitation, reports, analyses, e-mails or any other derivative embodiments of the Proprietary Information, , together with all copies thereof, in its possession or control and furnish the Disclosing Party with written certification of destruction.

The Receiving Party shall ensure that all copies of Proprietary Information stored electronically on its server, tape backup or on the hard drives of computers used by Receiving Party's Affiliates in connection with the Pilot Study have been permanently deleted and Receiving Party shall certify such deletion in writing to the Disclosing Party.\n12. Each party shall bear all costs and expenses incurred by it under or in connection with this Agreement, provided, however, that the prevailing party in any litigation commenced to enforce or construe the terms of this Agreement shall be entitled to collect from the other party the costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorneys' fees. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as an obligation by either party to enter a contract, subcontract, or other business relationship with the other party in connection with the Pilot Study.\n13.

With respect to all such information, including any reports or other documents resulting from such exchange of information between the Parties. Each of the Parties agree to the following terms:\n1. \"Confidential Information\" means all information provided by either Party in writing or visual form which Party desires to protect from disclosure and which is marked with an appropriate stamp or legend designating such material as \"Confidential\"; and all information provided orally by a Party which that Party desires to protect from disclosure provided that such information is identified as Confidential at the time it is transmitted and is subsequently confirmed as such in writing by the disclosing Party within fifteen (15) days after such verbal transmittal.\n2. For a period of five (5) years following the date of each such disclosure or development the receiving Party shall maintain such Confidential Information as confidential, except:\n(a) Confidential Information which is or becomes known publicly through no fault of the receiving Party; or\n(b) Confidential Information learned by the receiving Party from a third party entitled to disclose it; or\n(c) Confidential Information already known to the receiving Party before receipt from the disclosing Party as shown by the receiving Party's written records; or\n(d) Confidential Information which is independently developed by the receiving Party as shown by the receiving Party's written records; or\n(e) Confidential Information which must be disclosed under operation of law.\n(f) Confidential Information which is approved for release by written authorization of the disclosing Party\n3.

      "text": "NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\n This Non-Disclosure Agreement (the \"Agreement\") is entered into as of July 26, 2002 by and between Big Sky Transportation Company (\"Big Sky\") and Mesaba Holdings, Inc. (\"Holdings\").\n In connection with a potential transaction (the \"Transaction\") between Holdings and Big Sky, Big Sky has and will furnish to Holdings certain information (\"Information\") including but not limited to financial, marketing and operational information, and such other information necessary for Holdings to evaluate the transaction. The term \"Information\" shall mean all information that Big Sky has furnished or is furnishing to Holdings, whether furnished before or after the date of this Agreement, whether tangible or intangible and in whatever form or medium provided, as well as all information generated by Holdings or by its Representatives, as defined below, that contains, reflects or is derived from the furnished information.\n In consideration of Big Sky's disclosure to Holdings of the Information, Holdings agrees that it will keep the Information confidential and that the Information will not, without the prior written consent of Big Sky, be disclosed by Holdings or by its officers, directors, employees, agents or representatives (collectively, \"Representatives\"), in any manner whatsoever, in whole or in part, and shall not be used by Holdings or by its Representatives, other than in connection with evaluating the Transaction. Moreover, Big Sky agrees to transmit the Information only to such of its Representatives who need to know the Information for the sole purpose of assisting Holdings in evaluating the Transaction and who are informed of this Agreement.\n Notwithstanding the foregoing, the above restrictions shall not apply to the following:\n(i) Information that is publicly available at the time of disclosure (through no act of Holdings of any of its Representatives);\n(ii) Information that is disclosed to Holdings by a third party that did not disclose it in violation of a duty of confidentiality;\n(iii) Information that was known to Holdings before such Information was provided to it or its Representatives by or on behalf of Big Sky;\n(iv) disclosures that are required to be made by Holdings or any of its Representatives under legal process by subpoena or other court order or other applicable laws or regulations (provided, however, that Holdings makes reasonable efforts to provide copies of such Information to, or informs Big Sky before disclosure), or that are requested by Big Sky.\n Without the prior written consent of Big Sky, neither Holdings nor its Representatives shall disclose to any person the fact that Holdings has received any Information or that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning the Transaction, including the status thereof. Likewise, without the prior written consent of Holdings, neither Big Sky nor its Representatives shall disclose to any person the fact that Holdings has received any Information or that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning the Transaction, including the status thereof.\n Big Sky and Holdings agree that, at the conclusion of their review of the Information, or within three business days of the other's request, all copies of the Information, in any form whatsoever, will be delivered by Holdings and its Representatives to Big Sky.\n Neither Big Sky nor any of its Representatives has made or makes any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of the Information. Holdings agrees that neither Big Sky nor any of its Representatives shall have any liability to it or to any of its Representatives resulting from the provision or use of the Information.\n Each party acknowledges that it has been informed that the other party is a publicly-traded corporation and that the Information and the Transaction must be secured from any use or dissemination until such time as proper disclosure can be provided to shareholders and the securities markets in order to protect the interests of shareholders of each party and so that the rules and statutes pertaining to information about and trading in publicly held securities can be followed. During\nsuch time as the parties are involved in discussions or negotiations concerning the Transaction and for a period of at least 60 days after conclusion thereof, neither party shall engage in any transactions whatsoever regarding the common stock of the other, whether publicly traded or privately held, registered or nonregistered, including, but not limited to, buying, selling, taking or granting options in or making or receiving offers or tender offers to buy, sell, trade, or exchange any stock of the other, without the express written consent of the other and without first fully complying with all applicable securities laws and regulations and the rules of all exchanges upon which the stock of each respective party is traded, provided however, that the foregoing shall not be construed to limit the right of either party to invest in mutual funds or other commercially available investment vehicles that may acquire the stock of the other party.\n Each party acknowledges and agrees that in the event of any breach of this Agreement by it, the other would be irreparably and immediately harmed and could not be made whole by monetary damages. Accordingly, it is agreed that, in addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled at law or in equity, each party shall be entitled to an injunction of injunctions (without the posting of any bond and without proof of actual damages) to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and/or to compel specific performance of this Agreement, and that neither party nor any of its Representatives will oppose the granting of such relief.\n No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege preclude any other or further exercise thereof.\n Big Sky and Holdings agree that, unless and until a definitive agreement between them with respect to the Transaction has been executed and delivered, neither Holdings nor Big Sky will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to the Transaction by virtue of this or any other written or oral expression by either party or by any of their respective Representatives except, in the case of this Agreement, for the matters specifically agreed to herein. This Agreement may be modified or waived only by a separate writing by Holdings and Big Sky expressly so modifying or waiving such Agreement.\n This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Minnesota applicable to contracts between residents of Minnesota that are to be wholly performed within such state. Big Sky and Holdings hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waive the right to a jury trial in connection with any claim arising out of related to this Agreement, the Information, or the Transaction.\n In witness whereof, this Agreement has been executed as of the date first written above.\nBIG SKY TRANSPORTATION CO.\nBy: /s/ KIM B.

      "text": "Exhibit (d)(10)\nNON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nTHIS NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT (\u201cAgreement\u201d) between Universal Hospital Services, Inc. (\u201cUHS\u201d) and Emergent Group, Inc. (\u201cCompany\u201d), is effective October 26, 2010.\nWhereas, UHS and Company intend to engage in confidential discussions for the purpose of evaluating a potential business transaction between UHS and Company (\u201cBusiness Transaction\u201d), and as part of the Business Transaction, each party anticipates that it will disclose to the other party certain information that its deems confidential and/or proprietary.\nNow, therefore, to assure the confidentiality of the parties\u2019 confidential information and to prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure of this information, UHS and Company agree as follows:\n1. Confidential Information Defined. The term \u201cConfidential Information\u201d means all confidential and proprietary information belonging to one party (the \u201cDisclosing Party\u201d) that is revealed to the other party (the \u201cReceiving Party\u201d) during the Disclosure Period, which begins on the effective date and ends April 26, 2011. Confidential Information, regardless of the form in which it appears, may include, without limitation, information about customers, business and marketing plans, financial data, expertise of employees, forecasts and strategies that is related to the business of the Disclosing Party and is of the type of information that would reasonably be deemed to be confidential.\n2. Use Restriction. The Receiving Party agrees to use the Confidential Information for the sole purpose of evaluating and negotiating the Business Transaction.\n3. Disclosure Restrictions and Exceptions. The Receiving Party will disclose Confidential Information only to its employees and to its representative whose participation is necessary or helpful to evaluate and advance to the Business Transaction and who have agreed to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. The Receiving Party will limit the unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information by using the same degree of care, but no less than a reasonable degree of care, as the Receiving Party uses to protect its own confidential information. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Receiving Party is not prohibited from disclosing Confidential Information it is legally compelled to disclose (by deposition, subpoena, civil investigative demand, court order or otherwise), provided that the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prompt written notice of any such required disclosure so that the Disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy. If such protective order or other remedy is not obtained and the Disclosing Party has not waived compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, the Receiving Party will furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which the Receiving Party is advised by opinion of counsel it is legally required to furnish and will exercise reasonable efforts to limit the scope and content of such disclosure and obtain confidential treatment of such Confidential Information, Furthermore, the Receiving Party\u2019s obligations under this Agreement do not apply with respect to any Confidential Information that (a) is or becomes generally available to the public other than from the improper action of the Receiving Party, (b) is developed by the Receiving Party without reference to the Confidential Information, (c) was in the Receiving Party\u2019s possession before receipt from the Disclosing Party, or (d) is received by the Receiving Party from a third party who is not subject to an obligation of confidentiality owed to the Disclosing Party.\n4. Nondisclosure of Possible Business Transaction. Except as permitted by the previous paragraph, neither the Receiving Party nor the Receiving Party\u2019s representatives will disclose to any person the fact that the Confidential information has been made available to the Receiving Party or the Receiving Party\u2019s representatives or that the Receiving Party or the Receiving Party\u2019s representatives have inspected any portion of the Confidential Information.\n5. Waiver. The failure of a party to insist, in one or more instances, upon performance of any of the provisions or conditions of this Agreement will not be construed as a waiver of any other provision or condition of this Agreement, and no present waiver will be construed as a future waiver of such provision or condition.\n6. Remedies. Because of the unique and proprietary nature of Confidential Information, it is understood and agreed that remedies at law for a breach by the Receiving Party of its obligations under this Agreement may be inadequate and that in the event of such breach or threatened breach the Disclosing Party will be entitled to seek equitable relief, including without limitation injunctive relief and specific performance. The remedies set forth in this Section are in addition to any other remedies available for any such breach or threatened breach, including the recovery of damages from the breaching party.\n7. Assignment. This Agreement is not assignable by either party without the prior express written consent of the other, except that UHS may assign this Agreement to an affiliate or to a successor in interest to which the business relates.\n8. Entire Agreement and Amendment. This Agreement states the entire understanding of the parties regarding the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information and it cannot be altered or amended without a writing signed by both parties. This Agreement will not be construed to create any obligation on the part of either party to retain the other party\u2019s services or to compensate the other party in any manner.\n9. Return of Confidential Information. Upon the written request of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party will promptly return to the Disclosing Party or destroy all documents or other materials furnished by the Disclosing Party constituting Confidential Information, together with all copies thereof in the possession, custody or control of the Receiving Party, without retaining any copies. Any destruction must be confirmed by the Receiving Party to the Disclosing Party in writing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Receiving Party is not required to return or destroy computer files stored in the ordinary course of its business as a result of automated back-up procedures (subject, however, to the confidentiality restrictions set forth herein).\n10. Term. The Receiving Party\u2019s obligations imposed pursuant to this Agreement will continue for two years from the date hereof. ACCEPTED AND AGREED TO:\nUniversal Hospital Services, Inc.

      "text": "Exhibit 99(d)(7)\nNON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nThis Mutual Non-disclosure Agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) is entered into and effective as of the 28 day of November, 2017, by and between:\nBlackstreet Capital Holdings, LLC, a Delaware LLC having the address specified on the signature page (the \u201cPotential Acquiror\u201d)\n- and -\nthe undersigned Potential Acquiree, a Delaware corporation, having the address specified on the signature page (the \u201cCompany\u201d)\nRECITALS:\nA. The parties to this Agreement want to enter into discussions concerning a potential business transaction, including a potential acquisition transaction (the \u201cProposed Transaction\u201d).\nB. In connection with such discussions, the parties contemplate exchanging information, including confidential and proprietary information.\nC. Each party agrees to protect the proprietary and confidential information of the other.\nNOW THEREFORE in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties agree to the following:\nScope of Confidential Information\n1. \u201cConfidential Information\u201d means, for each party, whether in oral, written or in electronic form:\n(i) any information, data, intellectual property (including trade secrets), facts and financial information relating to the existing or proposed business, products, customers or services of such party and its affiliates that are treated as confidential by it, or ought to be considered confidential from their nature or the circumstances surrounding their disclosure; (ii) the existence of, and either party's potential participation in, the Proposed Transaction (including the contents and details of any discussions and negotiations of the terms, conditions and other matters with respect thereto); and (iii) any reports, analyses, forecasts, memoranda, compilations, studies, notes or summaries of such information, or other written or electronic documents prepared by, or on behalf of or for the Recipient or affiliates, directors, officers, managers, employees, shareholders, members or other equity holders, agents or advisors (\u201cRepresentatives\u201d) of the Recipient, to the extent that they use, contain, relate to, reflect, or are derived from such information (collectively, \u201cDerivative Confidential Information\u201d).\n2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, information which would otherwise be considered \u201cConfidential Information\u201d, is not subject to the terms of this Agreement if such information is:\n(a) in the public domain other than as a consequence of a breach of the obligations contained in this Agreement or other duty of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party relating to such information;\n(b) known by the party receiving the Confidential Information (the \u201cRecipient\u201d) prior to the disclosure of the Confidential Information by the disclosing party (the \u201cDisclosing Party\u201d) without any other obligation of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party;\n(c) independently developed by the Recipient without breach of this Agreement or other duty of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party relating to such information; or\n(d) received by the Recipient from a third party who is not subject to obligations similar to the obligations contained in this Agreement, including any duty of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party relating to such information.\nObligation to Maintain Confidentiality\n3. The Recipient will keep, and will cause its Representatives to keep, the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party confidential. The Recipient will not disclose the Confidential Information or use or permit the Confidential Information to be disclosed or used, to or by any person except Recipient\u2019s Representatives, in each case, who agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. In any such case Confidential Information will be disclosed only to those Representatives with a need to know the Confidential Information for the purpose of the Proposed Transaction, and (iv) only so much of the Confidential Information as is necessary for a particular individual to perform his or her function will be disclosed to that individual. Under no circumstances shall the Recipient or its Representatives use the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information in any manner or for any purpose other than evaluating and negotiating the Proposed Transaction. In any event, the Recipient will be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by its Representatives.\n4. The Recipient agrees to take all reasonable steps (including those steps that the Recipient takes to protect its own information, data or other tangible or intangible property that it regards as confidential) to ensure the confidentiality of the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information.\n5. Except as provided in Section 3, the Recipient will not, without the consent of the Disclosing Party, (i) disclose to any person the fact that it has obtained the Confidential Information, or (ii) make any disclosure respecting any Proposed Transaction between the parties to any third party, including, without limitation, any suppliers, customers or clients of each party.\n6. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement, the Company and its Representatives may disclose to other potential parties for a Proposed Transaction that it is considering or negotiating a Proposed transaction and the terms and conditions thereof, but may not disclose the involvement of the Company or any other information identifying the involvement of the Company.\n7. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement, the Company or any of its Representatives may disclose Confidential Information to the extent necessary to defend any litigation claim or cause of action brought against it by the other party relating to the Proposed Transaction or this Agreement; provided that the Disclosing Party agrees to use (and to cause its applicable Representatives to use) reasonable efforts, at the other party's expense, to obtain assurances that any such disclosed Confidential Information will be afforded confidential treatment.\n8. If the Recipient, or anyone else to whom Confidential Information is provided as permitted by this Agreement, receives notice indicating that it may or will be legally compelled to disclose any of the Confidential Information, Recipient will make a reasonable effort to provide the Disclosing Party with prompt notice so that the Disclosing Party may seek, at its expense, a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with this Agreement. If a protective order or other remedy is not obtained for whatever reason, or if the Disclosing Party waives compliance with this Agreement, the compelled person will furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which Recipient is informed by advice of its counsel that it is required to disclose.\nOwnership of Confidential Information\n9. All right, title and interest in and to a Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information will remain the exclusive property of the Disclosing Party and the Confidential Information will be held in trust and confidence by the Recipient and its Representatives. No interest, license or any right respecting the Confidential Information, other than expressly set out in this Agreement, is granted to the Recipient under this Agreement by implication or otherwise.\n10. All written, electronic or oral information that contains any part of a Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information (including any Derivative Confidential Information) will remain the property of the Disclosing Party.\nReturn or Destruction of Confidential Information\n11. The Recipient will, within five business days of a written request by the Disclosing Party, confirm that it has destroyed the original provided to Recipient (and all copies made by it) any documents (in whatever form or medium) provided, or made available for review by, the Disclosing Party (including any Derivative Confidential Information). Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, the parties agree that destruction will not be made of (i) any electronic copy of any Confidential Information that was created pursuant to the standard electronic backup and archival procedures of the Recipient if (x) personnel of the Recipient whose functions are not primarily internal information technology in nature do not have access to such retained copies and (y) personnel of the Recipient whose functions are primarily internal information technology in nature have access to such copies only as reasonably necessary for the performance of their internal information technology duties (e.g., for purposes of system recovery). The parties further agree that they will continue to treat as confidential in accordance with the Agreement, any Confidential Information retained pursuant to the second sentence of this Section 11.\nNo Liability Regarding Confidential Information\n12. The Recipient acknowledges that (i) the Disclosing Party is not obligated to provide any information pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) the Confidential Information is being given to it without liability on the part of the Disclosing Party or any of its Representatives, and (iii) no representation or warranty with respect to the Confidential Information is made by the Disclosing Party or any of its Representatives. The Recipient agrees that neither the Disclosing Party nor any of its Representatives will have any liability to the Recipient or its Representatives resulting from the use of the Confidential Information by the Recipient or its Representatives.\nGeneral\n13. The Recipient agrees that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for an actual or threatened breach of this Agreement by the Recipient or its Representatives, and that any court having competent jurisdiction may enter a preliminary and/or permanent restraining order, injunction or order for specific performance, without posting any bond, in the event of an actual or threatened breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement, in addition to any other remedy at law or in equity available to the Disclosing Party.\n14. This Agreement will terminate on the first anniversary of the date hereof.\n15. The furnishing of Confidential Information pursuant to this Agreement does not obligate either party to enter into any further agreement or negotiation with the other or to refrain from entering into any agreement or negotiation with another party with respect to a Proposed Transaction or otherwise.\n16. Each of the provisions contained in this Agreement is distinct and severable and a declaration of invalidity or unenforceability of any provision by a court of competent jurisdiction will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties pertaining to its subject matter. No amendment or waiver of this Agreement will be binding unless executed in writing by the party to be bound.\n17. This Agreement may not be assigned by either party without the prior written consent of the other party.\n18. This Agreement is to be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to the principles of conflicts of law that would cause the laws of any other jurisdiction to be applicable.\n19. Each of the parties hereto expressly agree that they will not, and will not permit any of its Representatives to directly or indirectly, hire an employee of the other party, or solicit or induce any employee of the other party to leave such employee\u2019s position with the other party, for a period of one year. However, this paragraph shall not prohibit the Potential Acquiror or any of its affiliates from soliciting or hiring an employee who responds to a general solicitation of employment.\n20. To the extent that any Confidential Information includes materials subject to the attorney-client privilege or similar privileges or protections, such disclosure is inadvertent and the Disclosing Party is not waiving, and shall not be deemed to have waived or diminished, its attorney work product protections, attorney-client privileges or similar protections and privileges as a result of disclosing any Confidential Information (including Confidential Information related to pending or threatened litigation) to the Receiving Party.\n21. This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts (including by PDF) with the same effect as if the signatures to each counterpart were upon a single instrument, and all such counterparts together shall be deemed an original of this Agreement.\n22. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT. IN WITNESS WHEREOF the parties have caused this Non-Disclosure Agreement to be executed by their duly authorized representatives.\nCompany Name: Cartesian, Inc.\nBy: /s/ Donald J.

      "text": "Exhibit (d)(5)\nCONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT\nDecember 15, 2010\nVerizon Communications Inc.\n140 West Street\nNew York, New York 10007\nLadies and Gentlemen:\nYou have indicated an interest in evaluating a potential acquisition (the \u201cTransaction\u201d) of Terremark Worldwide, Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d). In evaluating the Transaction, you have requested certain information regarding the Company and the Transaction from the Company. As a condition to your receipt of such information, you agree to treat any information concerning the Transaction or the Company which is furnished to you in connection with evaluating the Transaction (all such information, collectively, the \u201cConfidential Information\u201d) in accordance with the provisions of this Confidentiality Agreement (this \u201cAgreement\u201d) and to take or refrain from taking certain other actions herein set forth.\n1. You hereby agree that the Confidential Information will be used solely for the purpose of evaluating and implementing the Transaction and that such information will be kept confidential by you; provided that any such information may be disclosed to your officers, directors, employees, affiliates, accountants, attorneys, financial advisors, consultants, other agents or representatives and financing sources (such Persons hereinafter collectively being referred to as your \u201cRepresentatives\u201d who need to know such information for the purpose of evaluating and implementing the Transaction, have been informed of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information, and have been advised that such information is to be kept confidential, and provided, further, that such officers, directors, employees, affiliates, accountants, attorneys, financial advisors, consultants, other agents or representatives and financing sources shall not be deemed to be your Representatives unless (but solely to the extent that) you furnish Confidential Information to them. You agree you will be liable for any breaches of the terms of this Agreement by such Representatives.\nYou and the Company also each agree, on behalf of itself, its affiliates and its and their respective Representatives, that it shall not, without the prior written consent of the other party hereto, disclose to any Person the fact that Confidential Information has been made available to you, that discussions or negotiations have taken place or are taking place concerning a possible Transaction or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to any such possible Transaction, including the status thereof.\n2. The term \u201cConfidential Information\u201d does not include any information which (a) at the time of disclosure or thereafter is generally available to or known by the public (other than as a result of its disclosure by you or your Representatives in breach of this Agreement), (b) was available to you or your Representatives on a non-confidential basis prior to disclosure by the Company, (c) becomes available to you or your Representatives on a non-confidential basis from a Person who is not known by you or your Representatives (as applicable) to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with the Company, or is not otherwise prohibited from transmitting the information to you or your Representatives (as applicable), or (d) is or was independently developed by you or your Representatives without reference to, incorporation of, or other use of any Confidential Information.\n3. Given the nature of the Confidential Information and our current discussions, the Company may be irreparably damaged by any unauthorized disclosure of any Confidential Information and you and the Company may be irreparably damaged by any unauthorized disclosure of our discussions or by any breach of this Agreement by you, the Company or the Representatives of you and the Company. Without prejudice to other rights and remedies otherwise available, you and the Company therefore agree that the other party hereto shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including an injunction or specific performance, in the event of any breach of the provisions of this Agreement by the other party hereto or the Representatives of the other party hereto.\n4. In the event you or any of your Representatives become legally compelled (by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigation, demand, order or similar process) to disclose any of the contents of the Confidential Information, or you or the Company or any of the respective Representatives of you or the Company become so legally compelled to disclose either the fact that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning a possible Transaction between the Company and you, or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to any such possible Transaction, including the status thereof, the Company and you each agrees that each party and its respective Representatives may do so without liability, but each party hereto also agrees (i) to promptly notify the other party prior to any such disclosure to the extent practicable and legally permissible and (ii) to cooperate with the other party in any attempt it may make to obtain a protective order or other appropriate assurance that confidential treatment will be afforded the Confidential Information.\n5. The Company may elect at any time to terminate further access by you to the Confidential Information. Following any written request by the Company, you agree, at the Company\u2019s election, to either promptly redeliver to the Company or destroy all written Confidential Information in your possession or your Representatives\u2019 possession, and you and your Representatives will not retain any copies, extracts or other reproductions in whole or in part of such written material. You further agree that all documents, memoranda, notes and other writings whatsoever prepared by you or your Representatives based on the Confidential Information shall be destroyed, and you shall delete, to the extent reasonably practicable, all Confidential Information from any computer or other electronic device. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such destruction or deletion shall be\nrequired where prohibited by law, regulation, regulatory process or proceeding, or stock exchange regulation, or where the Confidential Information is part of the record of proceedings of your Board of Directors; provided, that any such Confidential Information so retained shall continue to be held confidential in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.\n6. You and the Company also agree that, unless and until a binding agreement is entered into between the Company and you with respect to the Transaction, neither the Company nor you will be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to the Transaction by virtue of this or any other written or oral expression, except with respect to the matters specifically agreed to herein. Nothing contained in any discussions between you and the Company or in any Confidential Information shall be deemed to constitute a representation or warranty. Except for the matters set forth in this Agreement or in any such binding agreement, neither party shall be entitled to rely on any statement, promise, agreement or understanding, whether oral or written, any custom, usage of trade, course of dealing or conduct.\n7. You agree that certain Confidential Information may be deemed material non-public information under applicable securities laws. Without limitation of the other restrictions on use or transfer of Confidential Information described herein, you agree that while such information remains non-public, you will not engage, and will direct your Representatives not to engage, in any transactions in the securities of the Company in a manner which would constitute a violation of such laws.\n8. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of (a) 11:59 p.m. (New York time) on February 3, 2011 and (b) the execution of a definitive agreement between the Company and you relating to a Transaction, except for discussions with you regarding the Transaction, the Company and its affiliates shall not, and the Company shall cause its Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (w) solicit or knowingly encourage inquiries or proposals with respect to any offer or proposal to (i) sell, issue or otherwise transfer any equity securities (or securities convertible or exchangeable for equity securities) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (except in accordance with the terms of convertible securities outstanding on the date hereof and pursuant to employment arrangements entered into in the ordinary course from time to time), (ii) sell or otherwise transfer any material assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or (iii) effect any recapitalization, refinancing, restructuring, merger, consolidation or other business combination involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries (any of the foregoing hereinafter referred to as an \u201cAlternative Proposal\u201d), (x) solicit or encourage the initiation of (including by way of furnishing information) any inquiries or proposals regarding any Alternative Proposal, or (y) have any discussions with or provide any non-public information or data to any third party that would encourage, facilitate or further any effort or attempt to make or implement an Alternative Proposal.\n9, Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of a definitive agreement, if any, with respect to the Transaction and without prejudice thereto, each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that none of the other party or any of such other party\u2019s respective Representatives and none of the respective officers, directors, partners, shareholders, members, employees, agents or persons in control of such other party\u2019s Representatives makes any express or implied representation or warranty to such party, such party\u2019s Representatives or to any other person as to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information furnished by or on behalf of such party, and each party hereto hereby further acknowledges and agrees that none of such persons shall have any liability to the other party or any of such other party\u2019s Representatives relating to or arising from or in connection with such other party\u2019s use or the use by such other party\u2019s Representatives of any Confidential Information furnished by or on behalf of such party to such other party or its respective Representatives or for any inaccuracies contained therein or any omissions therefrom. Each party hereto also acknowledges and agrees that it is not entitled to rely on the accuracy or completeness of any Confidential Information furnished to it or its Representatives by or on behalf of the other party and that such party shall be entitled to rely solely on such representations and warranties as may be made to it and contained expressly in any definitive agreement with respect to the Transaction, to the extent in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in any such definitive agreement.\n10. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflicts-of-law principles. Each party hereto irrevocably and unconditionally (a) consents to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York and of the United States of America located in the State of New York for any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this agreement (and irrevocably and unconditionally agrees not to commence any such action, suit, or proceeding except in such courts), (b) waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such action, suit or proceeding in any such courts and (c) waives and agrees not to plead or claim that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.\n11 The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding solely upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. The Company agrees that you may assign all rights, powers, privileges, and obligations under this Agreement with respect to any or all of the proposed Transaction to any of your affiliates.\n12. This Agreement represents the entire understanding and agreement of the parties hereto and may be modified only by a separate written agreement executed by you and the Company expressly modifying this Agreement. This Agreement supersedes and cancels any and all prior agreements between the parties hereto, express or implied, relating to the Transaction; provided that the Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement dated as of November 13, 2009 between the parties hereto shall remain in full force and effect with respect to the matters contemplated thereby.\n13. For purposes of this Agreement, \u201cPerson\u201d shall be broadly interpreted to include any individual, corporation, company, partnership, limited liability company, trust or other group or entity (including any court, government or agency, commission, board or authority thereof, federal, state or local, domestic, foreign or multinational).\n14. This Agreement shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of (a) the closing of the Transaction contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) one (1) year after the date hereof.\n15. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed an original, but such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same Agreement.\n[Remainder of this page intentionally left blank.]\nPlease confirm your agreement with the foregoing by signing and returning to the undersigned a duplicate copy of this Agreement.\nSincerely,\nTERREMARK WORLDWIDE, INC.\nBy: /s/ Manuel D.

      "text": "QuickLinks -- Click here to rapidly navigate through this document\nMUTUAL NON-DISCLOSURE AND NON-SOLICITATION AGREEMENT\n This Mutual Non-Disclosure and Non-Solicitation Agreement (this \"Agreement\") is made as of September 6, 2001 between EarthLink, Inc., a Delaware corporation (\"EarthLink\"), and CIDCO, Incorporated., a Delaware corporation (\"CIDCO\"). EarthLink and CIDCO are sometimes referred to herein individually as a \"Party\" and collectively as the \"Parties.\"\n 1. Purpose. EarthLink and CIDCO wish to have discussions relating to a potential transaction (the \"Transaction\") between EarthLink (and/or its subsidiaries and stockholders) and CIDCO (and/or its subsidiaries and stockholders). In the course of such discussions, each Party expects to make available to the other Party and its Representatives (as defined herein) Evaluation Material (as defined herein) concerning the businesses, financial condition, operations, assets, properties, liabilities, and prospects of such Party. As a condition to making such information available, each Party is entering this Agreement and agrees that all Evaluation Material received by it or its Representatives from the other Party or any of its Representatives shall be treated in accordance with this Agreement.\n 2. Certain Definitions. As used in this Agreement: (i) the term \"Receiving Party\" means the Party receiving Evaluation Material; (ii) the term \"Furnishing Party\" means the Party providing Evaluation Material or causing Evaluation Material to be provided; (iii) the term \"Representatives\" means the directors, officers, employees, agents or advisors (including, without limitation, attorneys, accountants, investment bankers, financial advisors and other consultants and advisors engaged in connection with the review and evaluation of the Transaction) of the specified Party; and (iv) the term \"Evaluation Material\" means all proprietary and confidential information concerning the Furnishing Party or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, whether in verbal, visual, written, electronic or other form, which is made available by the Furnishing Party or any of its Representatives to the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives (\"Primary Evaluation Material\"), together, in each case, with all notes, memoranda, summaries, analyses, studies, compilations and other writings relating thereto or based in whole or in part thereon prepared by the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives (\"Derivative Evaluation Material\"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term \"Evaluation Material\" shall not include, and the Parties' obligations herein (other than their obligations under paragraph 6 of this Agreement) shall not extend to, information which (a) was rightfully in the possession of the Receiving Party prior to disclosure by the Furnishing Party; (b) was or is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of the Evaluation Material; (c) is now or hereafter becomes available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by the Receiving Party or any of the Receiving Party's Representatives in violation of this Agreement; (d) becomes available to the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Furnishing Party or any of its Representatives and such source is not, to the knowledge of the Receiving Party following reasonable inquiry, under any obligation to the Furnishing Party or any of its Representatives (whether contractual, legal or fiduciary) to keep such information confidential; or (e) is transmitted by or on behalf of the Furnishing Party after receiving written notification from the Receiving Party of the termination of discussions relating to the Transaction or written instructions from the Receiving Party not to furnish any further Evaluation Material.\n 3. Confidentiality and Use of Evaluation Material.\n (a) Confidentiality of Evaluation Material. All Evaluation Material (i) shall be used solely for the purpose of evaluating and considering the Transaction; (ii) shall be kept strictly confidential by the Receiving Party; and (iii) shall be provided by the Receiving Party solely to those of its Representatives to whom disclosure is reasonably required to facilitate the Receiving Party's evaluation or consideration of the Transaction, it being the intention of the Parties to restrict the dissemination of Evaluation Material to as small a working group as practicable. The Parties agree that all Evaluation Material is and shall remain the property of the Furnishing Party. Before providing access to Evaluation Material to any Representative, the Receiving Party shall inform such Representative of the confidentiality of the Evaluation Material, and shall advise such Representative that, by accepting possession of or access to such information, such Representative is agreeing to be bound by this Agreement. Each Party shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any of its Representatives.\n (b) Compulsory Disclosure of Evaluation Material. If the Receiving Party or its Representatives are requested or required in any judicial, arbital or administrative proceeding or by any governmental or regulatory authority to disclose any Evaluation Material (whether by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand, or otherwise), or the Receiving Party is so requested or required to disclose any of the facts disclosure of which is prohibited under paragraph (3)(c) of this Agreement, the Receiving Party shall give the Furnishing Party prompt notice of such request so that the Furnishing Party may seek an appropriate protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, and, upon the Furnishing Party's request and at the Furnishing Party's expense, shall reasonably cooperate with the Furnishing Party in seeking such an order. If, in the absence of a protective order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by the Furnishing Party, the Receiving Party is nonetheless, in the opinion of the Receiving Party's or (in the case of disclosure requested or required of a Representative, such Representative's) outside counsel or General Counsel, legally compelled to disclose Evaluation Material, the Receiving Party shall disclose only that portion of the Evaluation Material which the Receiving Party is legally required to disclose and, upon the Furnishing Party's request and at the Furnishing Party's expense, shall use all requisite reasonable efforts to obtain assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded to such Evaluation Material to the extent such assurances are available. Subject to the foregoing conditions and limitations, the Receiving Party may disclose Evaluation Material under the circumstances set forth in this paragraph (b) without liability hereunder.\n (c) Other Public Disclosure. Except (i) for such public disclosure as may be necessary, in the good faith judgment of the disclosing Party consistent with advice of counsel, for the disclosing Party not to be in violation of any applicable law, regulation or order, or (ii) with the prior written consent of the other Party, neither Party shall:\n (x) make any disclosure (and each Party shall direct its Representatives not to make any disclosure) to any person of (A) the fact that discussions, negotiations or investigations are taking or have taken place concerning a Transaction, (B) the existence or contents of this Agreement, or the fact that either Party has requested or received Evaluation Material from the other Party, or (C) any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to any proposed Transaction, including the status of the discussions or negotiations related thereto, or\n (y) make any public statement concerning a proposed Transaction.\n (d) Notice. If either Party proposes to make any disclosure in reliance on clause (i) above, the disclosing Party shall, to the extent practicable, provide the other Party with the text of the proposed disclosure as far in advance of its disclosure as is practicable and shall in good faith consult with and consider the suggestions of the other Party concerning the nature and scope of the information it proposes to disclose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party may make such public announcement or public statement if in the opinion of such Party's outside counsel or General Counsel, such public announcement or public statement is necessary to avoid committing a violation of law or of any rule or regulation of any securities association, stock exchange or national securities quotation system on which such Party's securities are listed or trade. In such event, the disclosing Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to give advance notice to the other Party and to consult with the other Party on the timing and content of any such public announcement or public statement.\n (e) Certain Securities Law Restrictions. Each Party acknowledges that the Evaluation Material may contain material nonpublic information concerning the Furnishing Party. Each Party further acknowledges its awareness of the restrictions imposed by federal and state securities laws on persons in possession of material nonpublic information. Nothing herein shall constitute an admission by either Party that any Evaluation Material in fact contains material nonpublic information concerning the Furnishing Party.\n (f) Contact with Employees and Representatives. Neither Party shall communicate with any employee of the other Party regarding the Transaction or disclose any Evaluation Material to any employee or Representative of the other Party, other than the employees and Representatives named on the working group lists provided by the Parties from time to time.\n (g) General. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, neither Party will be restricted from using the information contained in the Evaluation Material that is retained in the minds of Representatives who have had access to the other Party's Evaluation Material, unless such use shall infringe on any of such Party's patent rights, trademark rights or copyright rights.\n 4. Accuracy of Evaluation Material; No Representations or Warranties. Each Party acknowledges and agrees (a) that no representation or warranty, express or implied, is made by either Party or any of its respective Representatives as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Material, and (b) that the Parties shall be entitled to rely only on those representations and warranties (if any) that may be made in a definitive written agreement for the Transaction, signed and delivered by both Parties, and then only to the extent, and subject to the limitations, provided therein.\n 5. No Solicitation. For a period of one year subsequent to the termination of discussions regarding a Transaction, neither Party shall, without the prior written consent of the other Party, directly or indirectly solicit for hire any person currently employed by the other Party (or any of its subsidiaries) with whom the hiring Party first has contact, or who first becomes known to the hiring Party, in the course of the Parties' discussions and due diligence with respect to the proposed Transaction; provided, however, that the foregoing provision shall not prevent either Party, without such consent, from employing any employee who (i) contacts the hiring Party directly at his or her own initiative without any direct or indirect solicitation by or encouragement from the hiring Party, (ii) responds to a mass media solicitation or advertisement consistent with the hiring Party's past practices that is not directed at employees of the other Party or (iii) is identified by a third party executive search firm or employment agency without any assistance from such Party.\n 6. Return and Destruction of Evaluation Material. At any time after termination of discussions by either Party with respect to the Transaction, upon the request of the Furnishing Party, the Receiving Party shall promptly (and in no event later than five business days after such request) (a) redeliver or cause to be redelivered to the Furnishing Party all copies of all Primary Evaluation Material in the possession or control of the Receiving Party or its Representatives which is in a visual or written format and erase or destroy all copies of all such Primary Evaluation Material which is stored in electronic format, and (b) destroy or cause to be destroyed all Derivative Evaluation Material in the possession or control of the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives. Nothing herein shall obligate the Receiving Party to provide any Derivative Evaluation Material to the Furnishing Party. Notwithstanding the return, destruction or erasure of Evaluation Material hereunder, the Receiving Party and its Representatives shall continue to be bound by their confidentiality and other obligations hereunder.\n 7. Remedies. Each Party agrees that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of any provision of this Agreement by it or any of its Representatives, and that in addition to all other remedies which either Party may have, each Party shall be entitled to specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief as a remedy for any such breach. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach of this Agreement but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity. No failure or delay by either Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder. In the event that either Party should institute proceedings to enforce any provision of this Agreement, the prevailing Party in such proceedings shall be entitled to recover all expenses relating to the enforcement of this Agreement, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, in addition to any other remedies.\n 8. Communications. CIDCO recognizes EarthLink will incur substantial expenses in conducting a due diligence investigation of CIDCO, and in consideration for EarthLink's doing so, CIDCO agrees to cease and terminate immediately, and to cause its Representatives to cease and terminate immediately, any negotiations (other than with EarthLink and its Representatives) with respect to any proposals relating to any business combination, tender offer or acquisition transaction involving the acquisition by any third party of all or any portion of the stock or assets of CIDCO (any such proposal being a \"Third-Party Offer\" and any such acquisition being a \"Third-Party Acquisition\"). In addition, CIDCO agrees that from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of (a) the date a definitive agreement for EarthLink's acquisition of CIDCO is executed, or (b) October 31, 2001 (as the same may be extended by mutual written agreement of the parties, the \"Restricted Period\"), CIDCO will not, and will not authorize or permit any of its Representatives, to directly or indirectly, solicit, consider or encourage any inquiries or proposals for (or which may reasonably be expected to lead to) any Third-Party Offer, or engage in discussions, conversations, negotiations or other communications with or provide any information to, or otherwise assist or cooperate with any person, entity or group in connection with any Third-Party Offer. Immediately upon receipt of any Third-Party Offer or related inquiry during such period, CIDCO agrees to inform EarthLink of the fact of such Third-Party Offer or related inquiry, including, among other things, the identity of the third-party making such offer or inquiry. Without limiting its application to the entirety of this Agreement, the provisions of Section 7 hereof, including without limitation EarthLink's remedies of specific performance and injunction, shall be specifically applicable to violations of this first paragraph of Section 8.\n Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, nothing contained in this Section 8 shall prohibit the Board of Directors of CIDCO from, only to the minimum extent required, complying with the mandatory disclosure requirements of Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder with regard to an unsolicited Third-Party Offer, pursuant to advice of outside legal counsel, provided, that any recommendation by the Board of Directors other than to recommend rejection of such offer shall be considered an immediate breach of this Section 8.\n In consideration of the efforts and resources to be expended by EarthLink in its due diligence investigation of CIDCO and related matters, CIDCO agrees that in the event that it violates any provision of the first or second paragraphs of this Section 8 in any manner during the Restricted Period, CIDCO shall become liable to pay, and shall immediately pay, to EarthLink One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) plus the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of EarthLink including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and other professional charges incurred by EarthLink in connection with the proposed Transaction. The parties hereby agree that EarthLink would be substantially harmed as a result of such a violation of this Section 8, that the specific damages incurred by EarthLink would be difficult of determination, and that this amount constitutes a reasonable estimate of such damages to be incurred by EarthLink and shall constitute reasonable liquidated damages for a breach of this Section 8.\n 9. Miscellaneous.\n (a) No License. Neither Party grants a license, by implication or otherwise, under any of its trade secrets or other intellectual property rights to the Receiving Party. The terms of this Agreement shall not be construed to limit either Party's right to independently develop or acquire products without use of the other Party's Evaluation Material. The Furnishing Party acknowledges that the Receiving Party may currently or in the future develop information internally, or receive information from other parties, that is similar to the Evaluation Material. Accordingly, nothing in this Agreement will be construed as a representation or agreement that the Receiving Party will not develop or have developed for it products, concepts, systems, or techniques that are similar to or compete with the products, concepts, systems or techniques contemplated by or embodied in the Evaluation Material, provided that\nthe Receiving Party does not violate any of its obligations under this Agreement in connection with such development.\n (b) Entire Agreement. This Agreement contains the sole and entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the confidentiality of the Evaluation Material and the confidentiality of their discussions, negotiations and investigations concerning a Transaction.\n (c) Amendment and Waiver. This Agreement may be amended, modified or waived only by a separate written instrument duly signed and delivered by or on behalf of both Parties.\n (d) Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not impair or affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement unless the enforcement of such provision in such circumstances would be inequitable.\n (e) No Obligation to Complete a Transaction. It is expressly understood that this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, constitute an agreement to consummate a Transaction, to conduct or continue negotiations with respect to a Transaction, or to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Transaction, and neither Party shall have any rights or obligations of any kind whatsoever with respect to such a Transaction by virtue of this Agreement or by virtue of any other written or oral expression by the Parties' respective Representatives unless and until a definitive agreement with respect to a Transaction is executed and delivered by both Parties, other than for the matters specifically agreed to herein. Both Parties further acknowledge and agree that each Party reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to provide or not to provide Evaluation Material to the Receiving Party under this Agreement, to reject any and all proposals made by the other Party or any of its Representatives with regard to a Transaction, and to terminate discussions and negotiations at any time. If either Party determines not to proceed with negotiations with respect to a Transaction, it will promptly inform the other Party of such determination.\n (f) Governing Law; Forum. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Georgia, without regard to the principles of the conflict of laws thereof. Each Party consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the State of Georgia, and the city of Atlanta, for the adjudication of any action, suit, or proceeding arising out of or otherwise relating to this Agreement.\n [Signatures on following page]\n The Parties have executed this Agreement as of the date first written above.\nEarthLink, Inc.

      "text": "Exhibit (d)(3)\nNON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nIn connection with a potential transaction (\u201cProposed Transaction\u201d) between 3M Company (\u201cInterested Party\u201d or \u201cReceiving Party\u201d), and Cogent, Inc., a Delaware corporation (\u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cDisclosing Party\u201d), the parties wish to protect and preserve the confidential and/or proprietary nature of certain information and materials of the Company that may be disclosed or made available to the Interested Party or its Representatives (as defined below) in connection with certain discussions, negotiations or dealings between the parties relating to the Proposed Transaction.\nIn consideration of the foregoing and the rights and obligations set forth herein, both parties hereby agree as of July 31, 2008 (the \u201cEffective Date\u201d):\n1. PROPRIETARY INFORMATION AND OTHER DEFINITIONS.\n1.1 \u201cProprietary Information\u201d means any and all information and material disclosed by Disclosing Party or any of its Representatives to Receiving Party or any of its Representatives in connection with the Proposed Transaction or in the course of the parties\u2019 evaluation and negotiation of the Proposed Transaction, together with all communications, data, reports, analyses, compilations, studies, interpretations, records, notes, lists, financial statements or other materials or information prepared by Receiving Party or any of its Representatives that contain or otherwise reflect or are based upon, in whole or in part, any Proprietary Information of Disclosing Party or that reflect the review of, interest in, or evaluation of all or any portion of the Proposed Transaction or Disclosing Party\u2019s business (collectively, \u201cDerived Information\u201d), whether tangible or intangible, furnished or prepared in writing or in oral, graphic, electronic or any other form or manner. In addition, Proprietary Information shall include (x) the fact that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning the Proposed Transaction or that Interested Party has made or may make an offer to acquire Company\u2019s stock or assets or that any Proprietary Information has been shared between the parties and their respective Representatives in connection therewith, (y) the proposed terms and conditions of the Proposed Transaction (including any financial terms and conditions) and the status thereof, and (z) the existence, context, and scope of this Agreement.\nProprietary Information shall not include information that: (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of any disclosure or other action or inaction by Receiving Party in breach of this Agreement (including any disclosure or other action or inaction by Representatives of Receiving Party that would constitute a breach of this Agreement if undertaken by Receiving Party itself); (ii) is or becomes known or avai1able to Receiving Party or any of its Representatives on a non-confidential basis from a source (other than Disclosing Party or any of its subsidiaries, affiliates or Representatives) that, to the best of the knowledge of Receiving Party, is not prohibited from disclosing such Proprietary Information to Receiving Party by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation; or (iii) is or was independently developed by Receiving Party or any of its Representatives without violation of any obligation under this Agreement.\n1.2 \u201cRepresentatives\u201d means as to any person, its directors, officers, employees, agents and advisors (including, without limitation, financial advisors, financing sources, attorneys, accountants and their respective Representatives).\n1.3 \u201cperson\u201d shall be broadly interpreted to include, without limitation, any corporation, company, partnership, other entity or individual.\n2. NON-DISCLOSURE AND LIMITED USE.\n2.1 Non-Disclosure. Without the written consent of Disclosing Party and except as otherwise required by applicable law, Receiving Party shall keep, and shall cause its Representatives to keep, all Proprietary Information confidential and shall not disclose or reveal, and shall cause its Representatives not to disclose or reveal, in any manner whatsoever, in whole or in part, any Proprietary Information to any person, other than to its Representatives who are actively and directly participating in its evaluation of the Proposed Transaction or who otherwise need to know the Proprietary Information for the purpose of evaluating the Proposed Transaction and who are bound by restrictions regarding the disclosure and use of such Proprietary Information (either contractual, legal or fiduciary) owed to Company, Interested Party or any their respective Representatives that are comparable to and no less restrictive than those set forth in this Agreement. Each party shall inform all of its respective Representatives and shall cause its respective Representatives to inform their Representatives who receive Proprietary Information hereunder of the confidential nature of such information and the Proposed Transaction, as well as the terms of this Agreement. Receiving Party shall not, and shall cause its Representatives to not, use any Proprietary Information for any purpose other than to evaluate the Proposed Transaction or in connection with the consummation of the Proposed Transaction. Each party shall be responsible for any breach of the terms of this Agreement by it or its Representatives.\n2.2 Degree of Care. Receiving Party shall take the same degree of care that it uses to protect its own confidential proprietary information of similar nature and importance (but in no event less than reasonable care) to protect the confidentiality and avoid the use, disclosure, publication or dissemination of the Proprietary Information of Disclosing Party. Receiving Party shall not, and shall cause its Representatives to not, decompile, disassemble or otherwise reverse engineer (except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law, notwithstanding a contractual obligation to the contrary) any Proprietary Information or any portion thereof, or determine or attempt to determine any source code, algorithms, methods or techniques embodied in any Proprietary Information or any portion thereof. Receiving Party shall not use Proprietary Information for any purpose or in any manner that would constitute a violation of any laws or regulations, including without limitation the export control laws of the United States.\n2.3 Designated Representatives. Neither Interested Party nor its Representatives shall initiate or maintain contact with any officer, director, stockholder, employee or agent of Company or its subsidiaries regarding the Proposed Transaction, except with the express consent of Company. All (i) communications regarding the Proposed Transaction, (ii) requests for additional information, (iii) requests for on-site access or management meetings and (iv) discussions or questions regarding procedures, will be submitted or directed to the Representatives designated by the Company.\n2.4 Compelled Disclosure of Proprietary Information. If Receiving Party or any of its Representatives are requested pursuant to, or required by, applicable law or regulation (including, without limitation, my rule, regulation or policy statement of any national securities exchange, market or automated quotation system on which any of Receiving Party\u2019s securities are listed or quoted) or by legal process to disclose any Proprietary Information, or any other information concerning Disclosing Party, its subsidiaries or affiliates, Receiving Party shall provide Disclosing Party with prompt notice of such request or requirement, in order to enable Disclosing Party (a) to seek an appropriate protective order or other remedy, (b) to consult with Receiving Party with respect to Disclosing Party\u2019s taking steps to resist or narrow the scope of such request or legal process or (c) to waive compliance, in whole or in part, with the terms of this Agreement. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or Disclosing Party waives compliance, in whole or in part, with the terms of this Agreement, Receiving Party or its Representatives, as the case may be, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to disclose only that portion of the Proprietary Information which Receiving Party is advised by legal counsel is legally required to be disclosed and exercise its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded to the Proprietary Information so disclosed.\n2.5 Attornev-Client Privilege. To the extent that any Proprietary Information may include material subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege concerning pending or threatened legal proceedings or governmental investigations, the parties understand and agree that thy have a commonality of interest with respect to such matters and it is their desire, intention and mutual understanding that the disclosure of such material is not intended to, and\nshall not, waive or diminish in any way the confidentiality of such material or its continued protection under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege and any such Proprietary Information shall remain entitled to all protection under these privileges, this Agreement, and under the joint defense doctrine. Nothing in this Agreement obligates any party to reveal material subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or my other applicable privilege.\n2.6 Definitive Agreement. Until a definitive agreement regarding the Proposed Transaction has been executed by the parties hereto, neither party hereto shall be under any legal obligation or have any liability to the other party of any nature whatsoever with respect to the Proposed Transaction by virtue of this Agreement or otherwise (other than with respect to the confidentiality and other matters set forth herein). Each party hereto and its Representatives (i) may conduct the process that may or may not result in the Proposed Transaction in such manner as such party, in its sole discretion, may determine (including, without limitation, negotiating and entering into a definitive agreement with any third party without notice to the other party) and (ii) reserves the right to change (in its sole discretion, at any time and without notice to the other party) the procedures relating to the parties\u2019 consideration of the Proposed Transaction (including, without limitation, terminating all further discussions with the other party). For purposes of this Agreement, the term \u201cdefinitive agreement\u201d does not include an executed letter of intent or any other preliminary written agreement in principle.\n2.7 No Representations or Warranties Regarding Proprietary Information. Subject to the terms and conditions of a definitive agreement regarding the Proposed Transaction and without prejudice thereto each party acknowledges that neither the other party nor its Representatives nor any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons of such Representatives makes any express or implied representation or warranty as to the completeness of the Proprietary Information or any use thereof. Each party hereby expressly disclaims all such warranties, including any implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement and accuracy, and any warranties arising out of course of performance, course of dealing or usage of trade. Receiving Party shall not be entitled to rely on the completeness of any Proprietary Information, but shall be entitled to rely solely on such representations and warranties regarding the completeness of the Proprietary Information as may be made to it in a definitive agreement relating to the Proposed Transaction, subject to the terms and conditions of any such agreement, should the discussions between the parties progress to such a point.\n3. NO SOLICITATION\n3.1 No Solicitation of Employees. Interested Party agrees that neither it nor its affiliates will at any time until the one year anniversary of the Effective Date, directly or indirectly, employ or solicit for employment (i) any key technical or management personnel of the Company that has first been introduced by the Company to the Interested Party in connection with the Proposed Transaction or who was otherwise substantively involved in the discussions of the Proposed Transaction or (ii) any other person who is now employed as an officer of the other party or any of its affiliates; provided, that the foregoing restrictions hall not be deemed to prohibit Interested Party or its Representatives from making general public solicitations for employment for any position or from employing any employee of the Company who either responds to such a general solicitation for employment or otherwise contacts Interested Party on his or her own initiative and without solicitation by Interested Party in contravention of the above restriction. Additionally, the above restriction shall not be deemed to prohibit Interested Party from making offers of employment or offering retention packages to any employees of Company or any of its affiliates in connection with the Proposed Transaction, provided that such offers have been disclosed to the Board of Directors of the Company.\n4. SECURITIES ISSUES.\n4.1 No Public Disclosure Required. Each party expressly confirms and agrees that, as of the date hereof, it is not required to make any public disclosure with respect to (a) the Proposed Transaction (or the terms or conditions of any other acts relating thereto), (b) any item of Proprietary Information (or the fact that Proprietary Information bas been made available to such party), or (c) any discussions or negotiations taking place between the parties with respect to the Proposed Transaction, whether pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or similar requirements related to general disclosure. If, after the date of this Agreement either party determines that any such disclosure is required, no such disclosure shall be made unless and until such party consults with the other party regarding the necessity and form of any such disclosure, and provides the other party a reasonable opportunity to review the proposed disclosure and comment thereon.\n4.2 Restrictions on Sales of Securities. Each party is aware, and will advise its Representatives who are informed of the matters that are the subject of this Agreement, of the restrictions imposed by the United States securities laws on the purchase or sale of securities by any person who has received material, non-public information from the issuer of such securities and on the communication of such information to any other person when it is reasonably foreseeable that such other person is likely to purchase or sell such securities in reliance upon such information. However, this will not prevent Receiving Party from purchasing stock through its benefit plans in the ordinary course of business.\n5. OWNERSHIP.\nAll Proprietary Information (including without limitation, all copies, extracts and portions thereof) is and shall remain the sole property of Disclosing Party, provided, that all Derived Information shall be the sole property of Receiving Party. Receiving Party does not acquire (by license or otherwise, whether express or implied) any intellectual property rights or other rights under this Agreement or any disclosure hereunder, except the limited right to use such Proprietary Information in accordance with the express provisions of this Agreement. All rights relating to the Proprietary Information that are not expressly granted hereunder to Interested Party are reserved and retained by Disclosing Party.\n6. TERM.\nExcept as otherwise provided herein, the obligations of this Agreement, including the restrictions on disclosure and use, shall terminate on the second anniversary of the Effective Date; provided that Sections 2.5, 2.6, and 2.7 and Articles 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.\n7. REMEDIES.\nReceiving Party agrees that, due to the unique nature of the Proprietary Information, the unauthorized disclosure or use of the Proprietary Information may cause injury to Disclosing Party, the extent of which will be difficult to ascertain and for which there may be no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, Receiving Party agrees that Disclosing Company, in addition to any other available remedies, may have the right to seek an immediate injunction and other equitable relief enjoining any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement ordered by the court. Receiving Party shall notify Disclosing Party immediately if Receiving Party has reason to believe that any person who has had access to the Proprietary Information (including Receiving Party or any of its Representatives) has violated or intends to violate the terms of this Agreement or otherwise disclose any Proprietary Information in violation of the terms hereof. Any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any ether remedy.\n8. RETURN OF MATERIALS.\nIf either party hereto shall determine that it does not wish to proceed with the Proposed Transaction, such party shall promptly advise the other party of that decision. In that case, or if the\nProposed Transaction otherwise is not consummated for any reason, Receiving Party shall, upon Disclosing Party\u2019s written request, promptly deliver to Disclosing Party all Proprietary Information, and, at Disclosing Party\u2019s sole election, return or destroy (provided that my such destruction shall be certified by a duly authorized Representative of Receiving Party) all copies, reproductions, summaries, analyses or extracts thereof or based thereon (whether in hard-copy form or on intangible media, such as electronic mail or computer files) in Receiving Party\u2019s or any of its Representatives\u2019 possession; provided, that if a legal proceeding has been instituted to seek disclosure of the Proprietary Information, such material shall not be destroyed until the proceeding is settled or a final judgment with respect thereto has been rendered. However, Receiving Party may retain in the office of its legal counsel, one copy of Proprietary Information for record purposes only. Notwithstanding the return or destruction of any Proprietary Information, or documents or material containing or reflecting any Proprietary Information, the parties will continue to be bound by their obligations of confidentiality and other obligations hereunder for the term of this Agreement (or such other term as may be applicable to the specific obligation), except as otherwise specifically provided herein.\n9.

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties concerning the confidentiality of the Proprietary Information in connection with the Proposed Transaction and related matters and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous representations, discussions.

No amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and signed by duly authorized signatories of both parties. The waiver by either party of a breach of or a default under any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach of or a default under the same or any other provision of this Agreement, nor shall any delay or omission on the part of either party to exercise or avail itself of any right, power, privilege or remedy that it has or may have hereunder operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other further exercise of any such right, power, privilege or remedy hereunder.\n9.4 Choice of Law.

      "text": "Exhibit (e)(5)\nMarch 17, 2010\nFLIR Systems, Inc.\n27700 SW Parkway Ave.\nWilsonville. OR 97070\nAttention: Mr. Craig Stoehr\nDirector - Corporate Development and Investor Relations\nConfidentiality Agreement\nLadies and Gentlemen:\nIn connection with your consideration of a possible transaction (a \u201cTransaction\u201d) involving ICx Technologies, Inc. or certain of its affiliates, subsidiaries, assets and/or business divisions (collectively, the \u201cCompany\u201d), you have requested information. In consideration of, and as a condition to, your being furnished with such information and any other Evaluation Material (as defined below), the Company hereby requests your agreement as set forth herein. As used in this letter agreement (this \u201cAgreement\u201d), the term \u201cEvaluation Material\u201d means all information regarding the Company, its businesses, technology, products, prospects and plans, a Transaction or the fact that the Company may pursue a Transaction with you or other parties, the existence and terms of this Letter Agreement and other information furnished to you in connection with the Transaction by the Company or any of its Representatives (as defined below), irrespective of form or medium of communication, whether prepared by the Company, its Representatives or otherwise and whether furnished before, on or after the date of this Agreement, together with any and all analyses, compilations, summaries, forecasts, studies or other materials prepared by you or your Representatives that contain, are based on or otherwise incorporate, in whole or part, such information. The term \u201cRepresentatives\u201d includes, without limitation, FLIR Systems, Inc.\u2019s affiliates and its and their respective directors, officers, employees, advisors, agents, representatives, financial institutions providing or underwriting solely debt financing or \u201ccontrolling persons\u201d (within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201c1934 Act\u201d)); provided, that, should you provide Evaluation Material to any such financial institution seeking to arrange debt financing, you shall promptly provide written notice to the Company as to the identity of any such financial institution. The Company is being advised by Stone Key Partners LLC and the Stone Key Securities division of Hudson Partners Securities LLC (together, \u201cStone Key\u201d).\nUse of Evaluation Materials\nYou and your Representatives (i) will use the Evaluation Material solely for the purpose of evaluating a possible Transaction with the Company involving you or your affiliates and (ii) will keep the Evaluation Material strictly confidential and (except as required by applicable law, regulation or legal process, and only after compliance with the paragraph titled \u201cCompelled Disclosure\u201d below) will not, without the Company\u2019s prior written consent, disclose any information in the Evaluation Material to any person, except that the Evaluation Material (or portions thereof) may be disclosed to those of your Representatives who need to know such information solely for the purpose of evaluating a possible Transaction with the Company (it being understood that prior to such disclosure your Representatives will be informed of the confidential nature of the Evaluation Material, will be provided with a copy of this Agreement and will agree to be bound by the terms hereof). You will make all reasonable, necessary and appropriate efforts to safeguard Evaluation Material from disclosure to anyone other than as permitted hereby. You agree to be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by your Representatives (including, without limitation, any actions or inactions by your Representatives that would constitute a breach if such Representatives were original signatories hereto).\nThe term \u201cEvaluation Material\u201d does not include any information which (i) at the time of disclosure or thereafter is generally known by the public (other than as a result of its disclosure by you or your Representatives) or (ii) was or becomes available to you on a non-confidential basis from a person not otherwise bound by a confidentiality agreement with the Company or its Representatives or prohibited from transmitting the information to you by law, contractual obligation, fiduciary duly or otherwise. As used in this Agreement, the term \u201cperson\u201d shall be broadly interpreted to include, without limitation, any corporation, company, joint venture, partnership, association or individual. You agree that the Evaluation Material is and shall remain the property of the Company or its subsidiaries and affiliates, as applicable, and that neither the Company nor any of its Representatives, subsidiaries or affiliates has granted you any license, copyright, or similar right with respect to any of the Evaluation Material or any other information provided to you by or on behalf of the Company.\nNon-Disclosure\nUnless otherwise required by applicable law in the reasonable written opinion of your legal counsel, but only after compliance with the paragraph titled \u201cCompelled Disclosure\u201d below, neither you nor your Representatives will, without the Company\u2019s prior written consent, disclose to any person either the fact that discussions or negotiations have taken or may take place concerning a possible Transaction, or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to any such possible Transaction, including, without limitation, the status thereof, the existence and terms of this Agreement and the fact that the Evaluation Material has been made available to you. Without limiting the foregoing, you hereby expressly confirm and agree that no public disclosure with respect to any discussions or negotiations concerning a possible Transaction is now required by reason of securities laws or similar requirements related to general disclosure and in the event you determine that such disclosure is required in the future, no such disclosures shall be made unless and until you have consulted, to the extent permitted by applicable law or cognizant authority, with the Company regarding the necessity and form of any such disclosure and otherwise complied with this paragraph.\nWithout limitation of the foregoing, you further agree that, without the prior written consent of the Company, you will not, directly or indirectly, enter in any agreement, arrangement or understanding, or any discussions which might lead to an agreement, arrangement or understanding, with any person regarding participation in a possible Transaction as a principal, coinvestor, an equity investor or any person other than a financial institution providing or underwriting debt financing. For the avoidance of doubt, the term \u201cRepresentatives\u201d as applied to you shall not include any such potential principal, co-investor, equity investor or person other than a financial institution providing or underwriting debt financing.\nCompelled Disclosure\nIn the event that you are requested or required to disclose all or any part of the information contained in the Evaluation Material pursuant to the terms of a valid and effective subpoena or order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or a federal, state or local governmental or regulatory body or pursuant to a civil investigative demand or similar judicial process or otherwise, to the extent permitted by applicable law or cognizant authority, you will (i) notify the Company in writing immediately of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding such request or requirement, (ii) consult with the Company on the advisability of taking legally available steps to resist or narrow such request or requirement, (iii) if disclosure of any such information is required, disclose only that portion of the information which, upon written advice of your legal counsel, you are legally required to disclose and (iv) exercise your best efforts to obtain a protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to such information. In any event, you will cooperate with the Company to obtain such a protective order or other assurance. Any expense you incur in connection with the Company\u2019s desire to narrow or limit the scope of the request or requirement shall be the responsibility of the Company.\nNon-Solicitation of Employees\nUntil the earlier of (i) the consummation by you of a Transaction, (ii) eighteen months after termination of discussions relating to a possible Transaction between you and the Company, and (iii) two years from the date of this Agreement, you will not, without the Company\u2019s prior written consent, directly or indirectly solicit for purposes of employment, offer to hire, entice away or offer to enter into any contract with, or hire any employee of the Company: provided, however, that this paragraph shall not prohibit you or any of your Representatives from engagement in any general advertising or general solicitation not targeted to the Company\u2019s employees or hiring employees who respond to such a solicitation with no other action or by you or your Representatives in violation of this provision: and provided, further, that, following execution by you and the Company of a definitive agreement providing for a Transaction between you and the Company, this paragraph shall not prohibit you or any of your Representatives from offering employees employment in anticipation of and conditioned upon the consummation of such Transaction.\nStandstill\nYou represent and warrant to the Company that, as of the date hereof, you do not beneficially own any securities of the Company or any securities or contract rights (other than broadly based index funds) the terms or value of which are dependent on securities of the Company. For a period of two years from the date of this Agreement, you will not, directly or indirectly, and you will cause any person or entity controlled by you not to, without the prior written consent of the Board of Directors of the Company, (i) in any manner acquire, agree to acquire or make any proposal to acquire, directly or indirectly, any securities or property of the Company or any of its affiliates, or any securities or contract rights (other than broadly based index funds) the terms or value of which are dependent on securities of the Company, (ii) propose to enter into, directly or indirectly, any merger, consolidation, recapitalization, business combination, partnership, joint venture or other similar transaction involving the Company or any of its affiliates, (iii) make, or in any way participate in any \u201csolicitation\u201d of \u201cproxies\u201d (as such terms are used in the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission) to vote, or seek to advise or influence any person with respect to the voting of any voting securities of the Company or any of its affiliates, (iv) form, join or in any way participate in a \u201cgroup\u201d (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the 1934 Act) with respect to any voting securities of the Company or any of its affiliates, (v) negotiate, have any discussions or enter into any arrangements, understandings or agreements (whether written or oral) with, or advise, finance, assist or encourage, any other persons in connection with any of the foregoing, or, make any investment in any other person that engages, or offers or proposes to engage, in any of the foregoing (it being understood that, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you shall not be permitted to act as a joint bidder or co-bidder with any other person with respect to the Company), (vi) otherwise act, alone or in concert with others, to seek to control or influence the management, Board of Directors or policies of the Company, (vii) disclose any intention, plan or arrangement inconsistent with the foregoing or (viii) advise, assist or encourage any other persons in connection with any of the foregoing. Unless and until you have received the prior written invitation or approval of the Company to do so, you also agree during such period not to (x) request the Company (or Company Representatives), directly or indirectly, to amend or waive any provision of this paragraph (including this sentence), (y) take any action which might require the Company or any of its affiliates to make a public announcement regarding this Agreement or the possibility of a merger, consolidation, business combination or other similar transaction, including, without limitation, a Transaction or (z) communicate with the Company\u2019s shareholders regarding the subject matter of this Agreement.\nProhibition on Trading\nIn addition, you hereby acknowledge that you are aware, and that you will advise your Representatives who receive any Evaluation Material, that the United States securities laws prohibit any person who has received from an issuer material, non public information from purchasing or selling securities of such issuer (and options, warrants and rights relating thereto) or from communicating such information to any other person under circumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person (including, without limitation, any of your Representatives) is likely to purchase or sell such securities. You hereby agree that neither you nor your Representatives will use or communicate the Evaluation Material in violation of these laws.\nReturn or Destruction of Documents\nIf you determine that you do not wish to proceed with a Transaction or your evaluation thereof, you will promptly advise the Company and Stone Key in writing of that decision. In that case, or in the event that (i) a Transaction is not consummated by you or (ii) at any time the Company so requests, you will promptly (a) deliver to the Company all of the Evaluation Material, including all copies, reproductions, summaries, analyses or extracts thereof or based thereon in your possession or in the possession of any of your Representatives or\n(b) destroy all Evaluation Material in your possession or in the possession of any of your Representatives (such destruction to be certified by you in writing to the Company). Notwithstanding the delivery or destruction of the Evaluation Material, you agree that you and your Representatives shall continue to be bound by your obligations under this Agreement.\nNo Unauthorized Contact\nUnless otherwise agreed in writing by the Company, all (i) communications regarding any possible Transaction, (ii) requests for additional information or Evaluation Material, (iii) requests for facility tours or management meetings, and (iv) discussions or questions regarding procedures, will be submitted or directed to Stone Key. You further agree not to contact any officers, directors or employees of the Company in connection with a possible Transaction without the prior written consent of the Company.\nNo Obligation, Representation or Warranty\nThis Agreement does not constitute or create any obligation of the Company or its Representatives to provide any Evaluation Material or other information to you, but defines the duties and obligations of you and your Representatives with respect to the Evaluation Material to the extent it may be disclosed or made available. Under no circumstances will the Company or any of its Representatives be obligated to disclose or make available any information, including, without limitation, any Evaluation Material, which the Company in its sole and absolute discretion determines not to disclose. You understand and acknowledge that none of the Company, Stone Key nor any of their respective Representatives is making any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Evaluation Material or any other information provided to you by or on behalf of the Company. None of the Company. Stone Key nor any of their respective Representatives shall have any liability to you or any other person (including, without limitation, any of your Representatives) resulting from your use of the Evaluation Material, other than as may be set forth in any definitive agreement providing for a Transaction and subject to the terms, conditions and limitations of any such agreement.\nYou agree that the Company will not be under any legal obligation of any kind whatsoever with respect to any Transaction by virtue of\n(x) this Agreement or (y) any written or oral expression or communication with respect to any Transaction by any of the Company\u2019s Representatives except, in the case of this Agreement, for the matters specifically agreed to herein. You further acknowledge and agree that (i) the Company shall be free to conduct the process for a Transaction as the Company in its sole discretion shall determine (including, without limitation, negotiating with any other person and entering into a definitive agreement without prior notice to you or any other person); (ii) any of the procedures relating to a Transaction may be changed at any time without notice to you or any other person; (iii) the Company shall have the right to reject or accept any potential proposal, offer or participant therein, for any or no reason whatsoever, in its sole discretion; and (iv) neither you nor any of your Representatives currently have any claim whatsoever against the Company, Stone Key or any of their respective Representatives arising out of or relating to a Transaction based on this Agreement or otherwise.\nActing as Principal\nYou represent and warrant that you are acting as a principal in any possible Transaction and are not represented by any broker or similar party.\nLegal Remedy\nYou acknowledge that money damages and remedies at law will be inadequate to protect the Company against any actual or threatened breach of this Agreement by you or by your Representatives and, without prejudice to any rights and remedies otherwise available to the Company, you agree to the granting of specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable remedies in the Company\u2019s favor without proof of actual damages, and you further agree to waive, and to cause your Representatives to waive, any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with any such remedy. In the event of any breach of this Agreement by you or your Representatives, you agree to reimburse the Company promptly upon demand for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by it in the enforcement of its rights hereunder (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel).\nGoverning Law\nThe validity and interpretation of this Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to conflicts of laws principles.

      "text": "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT\nThis agreement entered into as of December 5, 2013 sets out the terms under which Tennenbaum Capital, in its capacity of representative to the Corporation (as defined below), has agreed to provide information to Novacap Technologies III, L.P. (\u201cRecipient\u201d) about Dialogic Inc. and its affiliates (the \u201cCorporation\u201d) for the purpose of evaluating a possible transaction with the Corporation on a mutually agreeable basis (the \u201cPurpose\u201d).\n1. Confidential Information: \u201cConfidential Information\u201d means all information which is non-public, confidential or proprietary in nature, whether transferred in writing, orally, visually, electronically or by other means, disclosed by the Corporation or its representatives to the Recipient on or after the date hereof and for the Purpose. Confidential Information includes any reports, analyses or notes that are based on, reflect or contain Confidential Information. Confidential Information shall not include information that (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure, in violation of this agreement, by the Recipient or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors, members of its advisory committee, lawyers, accountants, auditors or representatives who have been informed of the Confidential Information by the Recipient (collectively, \u201cRepresentatives\u201d), (ii) was available to or known to the Recipient or its Representatives prior to disclosure by the Corporation or its representatives, (iii) is or becomes available to the Recipient or its Representatives from a source other than the Corporation or its representatives; provided that the source of such information was not known by the Recipient or its Representatives to be prohibited from disclosing such information to the Recipient or its Representatives by a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation, or (iv) has otherwise been independently acquired or developed by the Recipient or its Representatives without violating any obligations under this agreement.\n2. Non-disclosure of Confidential Information: During the period commencing on the date of this agreement and ending on the date of termination in section 9, the Recipient will take all commercially reasonable measures to ensure the continued confidentiality of the Confidential Information and shall not disclose it to anyone except (i) to the Recipient\u2019s Representatives under the limited terms and conditions set forth in section 3, or (ii) as permitted under section 4. Recipient further agrees not to disclose the contemplated transaction, the existence of discussions between the parties regarding the contemplated transaction or the nature or substance of those discussions to any person or entity other than the Corporation or its representatives. The Recipient shall be liable for any breaches by the Recipient\u2019s Representatives of the provisions of this agreement dealing with restrictions on disclosure and use of the Confidential Information.\n3. Use of Confidential Information: The Recipient shall use Confidential Information solely for the Purpose and for no other purpose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation understands that Recipient\u2019s business consists of acquiring or investing in businesses in various industries. Accordingly, nothing contained herein shall prevent or be interpreted as preventing Recipient from acquiring or investing in any business or entity that carries or that has carried activities competing with or related to those of any of the Corporation or its affiliates and any such acquisition or investment shall not, in itself, constitute a breach of the provisions of this agreement insofar as the Confidential Information is treated in accordance with the terms provided herein. The Recipient shall permit its Representatives access to the Confidential Information only to the extent necessary to allow them to assist the Recipient in the Purpose. The Recipient further agrees that prior to granting such Representatives access to the Confidential Information, the Recipient shall inform such Representatives of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information and of the terms of this agreement and require such Representatives to agree to abide by all the terms included herein.\n4. Required Disclosure: If the Recipient or any of its Representatives is requested to disclose any Confidential Information in connection with any legal or administrative proceeding or investigation, or is required by law, regulation, stock exchange or regulatory authority to disclose any Confidential Information, such person or entity will (i) promptly notify the Corporation of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding such a request or requirement (unless prohibited by law, regulation or order of a court or administrative tribunal) so that the Corporation may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy, or waive compliance with the provisions of this agreement, and (ii) if, in the absence of a protective order, such disclosure is required in the opinion of such person\u2019s or entity\u2019s counsel, such person or entity may make such disclosure without liability under this agreement, provided that such person or entity only furnishes that portion of the Confidential Information which is legally required, such person or entity gives the Corporation notice of the information to be disclosed as far in advance of its disclosure as practicable (unless prohibited by law, regulation or order of a court or administrative tribunal) and, upon Corporation\u2019s request and at Corporation\u2019s expense, such person or entity shall cooperate in any efforts by the Corporation to ensure that confidential treatment shall be accorded to such disclosed information.\n5.

However, Residuals does not include any detailed financial or personnel data. The ability to use Residuals shall be narrowly construed, is intended only to alleviate the possibility of inadvertent breach of this Agreement as a result of routine, unaided memory retention, and does not allow the receiving party to use or disclose information known to the receiving party to be Confidential Information that is subject to this Agreement. The memory of an employee of the receiving party is unaided if such employee has not intentionally memorized the Confidential Information or retained notes or other aids to such memory,\n9.
